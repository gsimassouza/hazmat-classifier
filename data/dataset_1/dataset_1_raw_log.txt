Batch 2:
Here's the analysis for each product based on the provided Hazmat definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will go through each product, examine its title and attributes to understand its nature, and then compare it against the Hazmat definition, examples of Hazmat, and examples of non-Hazmat goods. The key is to identify if any product contains substances that are radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, or if they are compressed gases/liquids or hot materials. I will also pay close attention to the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" provided.

**Product: MLB21693529 - Mesa Computador C/ Suporte Teclado E Prateleira Inglaterra Cor Preto**
*   **Analysis:** The product is described as a computer desk made of 'MDP' (Medium Density Particleboard), a common material for furniture. It's a finished piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The definition lists Hazmat as substances posing risks due to being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, including compressed gases/liquids or hot materials. Furniture made of MDP does not inherently possess these characteristics. It is not a chemical product, aerosol, or a battery sold separately.
*   **Non-Hazmat Indicators:** The definition explicitly lists "Furniture & Home Goods" as non-Hazmat.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is non-Hazmat.

*   **Analysis:** This product is an office cabinet made of 'MDP', a common material for furniture. It's a finished piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Similar to the desk, a cabinet made of MDP does not inherently possess characteristics of Hazmat such as flammability (beyond general combustibility of wood, which is not classified as Hazmat in finished furniture), corrosivity, toxicity, etc. It is not a chemical product, aerosol, or a battery sold separately.

Batch 5:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

I have evaluated each product by examining its title and attributes, then comparing them against the detailed Hazmat definition, including the nine classes of hazardous materials and the provided examples of both Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods. My focus was on identifying characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, explosiveness, or if the product is a compressed gas, radioactive, or falls into the "miscellaneous hazardous" category (e.g., lithium batteries sold separately, asbestos, dry ice). I also cross-referenced with the non-Hazmat indicators like furniture, complete electronic devices, basic tools, office supplies, and personal care items (non-aerosol).

For all the products provided, they are primarily furniture items, basic office supplies, or complete electronic devices/lighting fixtures. None of them contain substances explicitly listed or implied as hazardous within the provided definition (e.g., no flammable liquids like paint/thinner, no compressed gases, no corrosive chemicals, no standalone batteries, no toxic substances). Even items like "Adesivo Decorativo" or "Etiqueta Colacril" are finished goods, not bulk chemical adhesives, and thus do not pose a Hazmat risk according to the definition. Similarly, the pens included with the whiteboards are standard office supplies and not considered Hazmat unless specified as containing highly flammable or toxic inks, which is not indicated here.

Therefore, all products are classified as non-Hazmat.

Batch 6:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Title and Attributes:** I will examine the product's title and its associated attributes for keywords that indicate potential hazardous characteristics.
2.  **Consult Hazmat Definition and Examples:** I will cross-reference any identified characteristics with the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the nine hazard classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances). I will also check against the specific examples of Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods provided.
3.  **Apply Key Classification Principles:** I will consider the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" to guide the classification.
4.  **Determine `is_hazmat`:** Based on the above analysis, I will determine if the product falls under any Hazmat category.
5.  **Formulate `reason` and `confidence`:** If classified as Hazmat, I will state the specific reason (e.g., "Contains compressed gas," "Flammable liquid") and assign a confidence level (high, medium, low) based on the clarity and directness of the match with the definition. If non-Hazmat, these fields will be omitted as per the schema.

Batch 8:
Detailed Reasoning Process:

For each product, I will analyze its title and attributes to determine its primary nature, materials, and any specific characteristics that might align with the Hazmat definition. I will then compare these characteristics to the nine Hazmat classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances) and the provided examples of both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods.

**General Observation:** All products in this list appear to be common office furniture, accessories, or electronic devices. I will pay close attention to materials and any mention of chemicals, aerosols, or standalone batteries.

Batch 10:
Detailed reasoning process:

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I will refer to the provided `<hazmat_definition>` to classify each product. The definition clearly outlines what constitutes a hazardous material (substances posing risks due to characteristics like flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, etc.) and provides examples for each of the nine classes. Crucially, it also provides "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" which include categories like "Furniture & Home Goods", "Complete electronic devices", "Natural materials", "Basic tools and hardware", and "Office supplies".

2.  **Analyze Each Product:** For each product, I will examine its `TITLE` and `ATTRIBUTES` to determine its nature, materials, and intended use. I will then cross-reference this information with the Hazmat definition and its examples, particularly looking for any mentioned hazardous characteristics or materials.

3.  **Apply Classification Logic:**
    *   If a product clearly falls under one of the Hazmat classes or contains a substance explicitly listed as Hazmat, it will be classified as `is_hazmat: true`. I will state the reason and confidence.
    *   If a product clearly falls under the "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" and does not contain any explicitly hazardous components according to the definition, it will be classified as `is_hazmat: false`.
    *   If there's ambiguity or insufficient information to definitively classify as Hazmat, but some potential for risk exists, I would lean towards `is_hazmat: true` with `confidence: low` or `medium`. However, for these products, they appear to be standard furniture, office supplies, or home goods, which are explicitly non-hazmat.

Detailed reasoning process:

I will analyze each product based on the provided Hazmat definition, examples of Hazmat, and examples of non-Hazmat. The core principle is whether the product is a substance that poses a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment due to characteristics like flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, etc., or if it falls into specific hazardous classes (e.g., explosives, gases, flammable liquids). I will also consider the "Key Classification Principles" for Hazmat and Non-Hazmat indicators.

For the products provided, the titles and attributes consistently describe furniture items or home goods made from common materials like wood composites (MDP, MDF), metals (steel, metalon), plastics (polypropylene, foam), and textiles (cotton, polyester, TNT, silicone fiber). None of these materials, in their finished product form as described, are inherently hazardous according to the Hazmat definition. They are not chemical products, aerosol sprays, industrial chemicals, batteries sold separately, or substances that are flammable, corrosive, or toxic in the way defined for Hazmat. They clearly fall under the "Furniture and home goods" and "Natural materials" non-Hazmat indicators.

Therefore, all products are classified as Non-Hazmat.

Here is the classification for each product:

Batch 12:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will analyze each product based on the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the material composition and intended use. The key is to identify if the product contains any substance classified as explosive, gas (compressed/flammable/poisonous), flammable liquid/solid, oxidizing agent, organic peroxide, toxic, infectious, radioactive, corrosive, or miscellaneous hazardous substances (like asbestos, lithium batteries, dry ice, lead-based paints). I will also refer to the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" provided in the definition.

For each product, I will check if its title or attributes indicate the presence of:
*   Chemicals (acids, solvents, cleaners, pesticides, etc.)
*   Aerosol sprays or pressurized containers
*   Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances
*   Batteries (when sold separately)
*   Explosives or propellants
*   Radioactive materials
*   Infectious substances

Conversely, I will identify products that fall under "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" such as:
*   Complete electronic devices
*   Natural materials (wood, cotton)
*   Basic tools and hardware (non-chemical)
*   Office supplies (paper, pens, furniture)
*   Furniture and home goods

Batch 17:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Title and Attributes:** For each product, I examine the `TITLE` and `ATTRIBUTES` to understand its nature, materials, and intended use.
2.  **Consult Hazmat Definition and Examples:** I then compare this information against the provided `<hazmat_definition>`.
    *   I look for keywords or characteristics that indicate a potential Hazmat (e.g., "flammable," "explosive," "corrosive," "gas," "chemical," "battery sold separately," "aerosol").
    *   I also check if the product falls into any of the 9 Hazmat classes or the specific Hazmat examples provided.
3.  **Consult Non-Hazmat Examples and Indicators:** Concurrently, I check if the product aligns with the "Examples of goods classified as non-Hazmat" or "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" (e.g., "Furniture & Home Goods", "Complete electronic devices", "Basic tools and hardware").
4.  **Determine Classification:**
    *   If the product clearly matches a Hazmat characteristic or example, it's classified as `is_hazmat: true`, with a `reason` and `confidence: high`.
    *   If the product clearly matches a Non-Hazmat indicator or example, and shows no signs of hazardous properties, it's classified as `is_hazmat: false`.
    *   If there's ambiguity (e.g., a "chemical" without specific hazard details, or a product that *could* contain a hazardous component but isn't explicitly defined as such in its common form), I would lean towards `is_hazmat: true` with a `confidence: low` or `medium` as per the guideline "If not certain of the classification, output as hazmat with lower confidence." However, for this list, all products fall clearly into non-hazmat categories.

Batch 19:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product by comparing its title and attributes against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the material composition, form, and intended use. The Hazmat definition clearly outlines nine classes of hazardous materials and provides examples, as well as a list of non-Hazmat indicators like "Furniture and home goods", "Office supplies", and "Complete electronic devices".

For each product, I will determine if it falls into any of the Hazmat classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances). If it does not, and aligns with the non-Hazmat indicators, it will be classified as non-Hazmat.

Batch 21:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the hazardous characteristics (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, compressed gases/liquids, or hot materials) and the examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods.

*   **Furniture & Home Goods:** These are generally classified as non-Hazmat unless they contain specific hazardous components (e.g., lead paint, specific chemicals, or pressurized elements). The examples explicitly list "Furniture and home goods" as Non-Hazmat.
*   **Textiles/Rugs:** Similar to furniture, these are typically non-Hazmat. The definition lists "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)" as non-Hazmat. Polyester is a synthetic textile, but it's a finished good, not a hazardous chemical.
*   **Office Supplies (non-chemical):** Basic office supplies are listed as non-Hazmat.
*   **Complete Electronic Devices:** The definition specifies "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are non-Hazmat, even though they contain batteries. Batteries are only Hazmat "when sold separately".
*   **Dispensers vs. Contents:** A dispenser itself is not Hazmat. The *substance* it dispenses might be, but the product being classified is the dispenser.

Based on these principles, most of the products in the list, being office furniture, rugs, or decorative items, are expected to be non-Hazmat.

Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **Product ID: MLB26638075**
    *   **Title:** Adesivo De Parede Regua Altura Do Crescimento Decorativa Cor CASTELO
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a decorative wall sticker. It falls under the category of "Furniture & Home Goods" or "Office Supplies" which are explicitly listed as NON-HAZMAT Indicators. There are no attributes suggesting it contains any hazardous substances (e.g., flammable adhesives, toxic materials).
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

    *   **Title:** Rodinha Cadeira Rodízio C/ 5 Rodas Anti-risco Pu Escritório Roda Brcost
    *   **Analysis:** These are chair wheels made of silicone and ABS. This is a basic component for furniture, falling under "Furniture & Home Goods" or "Tools & Hardware (Non-Chemical)", which are NON-HAZMAT Indicators. There's no indication of hazardous materials.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **Product ID: MLB24144140**
    *   **Title:** Armário Aço Escritório Fechadura 4 Prateleiras Ea301 Azul

4.  **Product ID: MLB43793644**
    *   **Title:** Pistão Gás Coluna Universal Cadeira Reforçada Classe-4 180kg

The Hazmat definition specifies "compressed gases/liquids" as a characteristic of hazardous materials and lists "Gases" as Class 2 Hazmat, with examples like Nitrogen, Neon, Carbon dioxide (non-flammable, including cryogenic gases/liquids). A gas piston contains compressed gas, posing a risk due to pressure, even if the gas itself is non-flammable. This aligns with the "compressed gases/liquids or hot materials" aspect of the definition.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Contains compressed gas (Class 2: Gases).
    *   **Confidence:** High.

Batch 24:
Here's my detailed reasoning process for each product:

**Product 1: MLB23558389**
*   **Analysis:** The product is described as "Escrivaninha Com Estante Lateral" (Desk with Side Shelf) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The Hazmat definition lists categories like explosives, gases, flammable liquids/solids, toxic, corrosive, etc. Furniture is not mentioned in any of these categories. The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Furniture and home goods".
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 2: MLB23872415**
*   **Analysis:** The product is described as "Mesa Escritório/reunião" (Office/Meeting Table) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Similar to Product 1, this falls under "Furniture and home goods" in the non-Hazmat indicators.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 3: MLB47889550**
*   **Analysis:** The product is described as "Escrivaninha Beauty Mesa Computador Notebook" (Beauty Desk Computer Notebook Table) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** This falls under "Furniture and home goods" in the non-Hazmat indicators.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 4: MLB42843954**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Kit Trilho Eletrificado 1m C/ 4 Spots 10w 4000k Luz Neutra Estrutura Branco" (Electrified Track Kit with 4 Spots). It's an electrical lighting fixture made of plastic.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** This is a complete electronic/electrical device or fixture. The Hazmat definition does not list such items as hazardous unless they contain specific hazardous components like batteries (when sold separately) or a substance like mercury (which is not indicated here). "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are listed as non-Hazmat. This item is analogous to a complete electronic device.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 5: MLB22751885**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Etiqueta Adesiva Colacril A4" (A4 Adhesive Labels). This is an office supply item.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Office supplies".
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 6: MLB30177412**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Escrivaninha Penteadeira" (Desk Dressing Table) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** This falls under "Furniture and home goods" in the non-Hazmat indicators.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 7: MLB27307691**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Livreiro Space organizador livreiro" (Bookshelf Space organizer) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** This falls under "Furniture and home goods" in the non-Hazmat indicators.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 8: MLB26520588**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Pistão Gás Coluna Universal Cadeira Reforçada Classe-3 150kg Besser" (Gas Piston Universal Chair Column). The key term is "Pistão Gás," indicating it contains compressed gas.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The Hazmat definition for Class 2: Gases explicitly includes "compressed gases/liquids" like "Nitrogen, Neon, Carbon dioxide" (non-flammable gases). A gas piston for a chair contains compressed gas (typically nitrogen) to allow for height adjustment. This component itself is a container of compressed gas.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is a Hazmat.

**Product 9: MLB26732282**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Quadro Branco Standart" (Standard Whiteboard) with an aluminum frame. This is an office supply item.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Office supplies".
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

**Product 10: MLB35432181**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Escrivaninha Mesa De Canto 3 Gaveta" (Corner Desk with 3 Drawers) made of MDP. This is a piece of furniture.

**Product 13: MLB18628785**
*   **Analysis:** The product is "Cadeira de escritório Qualiflex Executiva ergonômica com braços" (Ergonomic Executive Office Chair with Arms). This is a complete piece of furniture. While office chairs typically contain a gas lift (which, when sold separately, is Hazmat as per Product 8), the chair itself is a complete furniture item.
*   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Furniture and home goods". In the context of complete devices or furniture items, components that might be Hazmat when sold separately (like batteries or gas pistons) do not necessarily make the entire assembled product Hazmat for general transport, unless the component poses a significant and primary hazard in its integrated form (e.g., large lithium batteries in certain electronics). A standard office chair is not typically classified or shipped as a Hazmat.
*   **Conclusion:** This product is not a Hazmat.

Batch 25:
Detailed Reasoning Process:

The provided Hazmat definition categorizes hazardous materials into nine classes based on their inherent risks (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, allergenic, compressed gases/liquids, hot materials). It also provides examples of both Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods, along with key indicators.

I will analyze each product against these criteria:

1.  **Lixeira Metal Aramado Telada Cesto Escritório 12 Litros (MLB21723187):** This is a metal waste bin. It is a finished good made of inert material (metal). It does not contain any hazardous substances and does not exhibit any hazardous characteristics (e.g., flammability, corrosivity, toxicity). This falls under "Furniture and home goods" or "Office supplies," which are explicitly listed as Non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **Escrivaninha Mesa De Canto Em L Vintage Cor Cobre Estilo Nórdico Para Home Office Escritório Industrial (MLB42250814):** This is an L-shaped desk made of MDP (wood composite) and metal.

1.  **MLB37016359 - Lixeira Redonda Inox 3l P/ Banheiro Cozinha Lavabo Powermaid Cor Prateado**
    *   This product is a stainless steel waste bin, which is a common home good/furniture item.
    *   It does not contain any substances identified as hazardous (explosive, flammable, toxic, corrosive, etc.) nor is it a pressurized container or a battery sold separately.
    *   The Hazmat definition's "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" include "Furniture and home goods".
    *   Therefore, it is classified as Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB47799903 - Mesa Para Escritório Escrivaninha Estilo Industrial Em Madeira Com Gaveta Cor Preto Web Home Móveis**
    *   This product is a desk made of MDF, which is a furniture item.
    *   It does not contain any substances identified as hazardous. The "Pintura UV" refers to the finish, not a hazardous chemical in its transportable form.
    *   The Hazmat definition's "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" include "Furniture and home goods".
    *   Therefore, it is classified as Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB25959535 - Mesa Para Escritório Diretor 1,80m Dynamica Cor Nogal / Est.Preta**
    *   This product is a desk, which is a furniture item.
    *   It does not contain any substances identified as hazardous.
    *   The Hazmat definition's "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" include "Furniture and home goods".
    *   Therefore, it is classified as Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB44986266 - Kit 10 Puxador De Gaveta Moderno/ Redondo Dourado Fosco 34mm**
    *   This product consists of drawer pulls made of Zamac (a metal alloy), which are basic hardware components.
    *   It does not contain any substances identified as hazardous.
    *   The Hazmat definition's "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" include "Basic tools and hardware" and "Furniture and home goods".
    *   Therefore, it is classified as Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB26616438 - Decorativo Árvore Genealógica Familia Retrato Verde Mdf Cor Preto**
    *   This product is a decorative item made of MDF.
    *   It does not contain any substances identified as hazardous.

7.  **MLB26913714 - 6 Glade Refil Automatic 269ml ( Lavanda/ Frutas/ Maciez)**

    *   The Hazmat definition includes "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" and "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)". While not explicitly an aerosol *can*, the term "Refil Automatic" for an air freshener suggests it may contain a pressurized gas or a highly volatile/flammable liquid designed for dispersion, similar to the "Antiperspirant aerosol deodorant" example given as Hazmat (Class 2 - Gases). Without specific chemical composition, the nature of the product (air freshener liquid/spray) points to potential flammability or other hazards.
    *   Therefore, it is classified as Hazmat.

Batch 30:
Here's the analysis for each product based on the provided Hazmat definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

For each product, I will examine its title and attributes to identify its primary function and materials. I will then cross-reference these details with the Hazmat definition, specifically looking for characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or if it's a gas, explosive, or radioactive substance. I will also consult the provided examples of both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods to ensure consistency in classification. Products like furniture, general office supplies, and finished electronic devices (where batteries are not sold separately) are generally considered non-Hazmat unless specific hazardous materials are explicitly mentioned in their composition or function.

**Product 1: MLB38093082**
*   **Analysis:** This product is a carpet/rug made of polyester, intended for rooms, living rooms, or offices. It falls under the category of "Furniture & Home Goods" which is listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous properties like flammability, toxicity, or corrosivity beyond what is typical for household textiles.
*   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 2: MLB50168118**
*   **Analysis:** This product is a large mirror with integrated LED lighting. It is a complete electronic device that plugs into an electrical outlet (127/220V).

Batch 31:
Reasoning Process:

I will analyze each product based on its title and attributes, comparing them against the provided Hazmat definition and examples. The key is to identify any characteristics that classify a product as radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, or if it involves compressed gases/liquids, hot materials, or falls into specific Hazmat classes (1-9). Conversely, I will look for indicators of non-Hazmat items such as food, complete electronics, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, personal care (non-aerosol), furniture, and home goods.

    *   **Hazmat Check:** The definition lists "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" as non-Hazmat. While these are components, they are not specifically listed as hazardous, nor do they contain materials like "Batteries (when sold separately)" or other listed Hazmat substances.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

    *   **Title:** 'Ipec Eletronica Tx Car mini 2 controle portão eletrônico farol seg garen rcg agl' (Ipec Eletronica Tx Car mini 2 electronic gate control headlight seg garen rcg agl)
    *   **Attributes:** Describes a remote control for an electronic gate. It is powered by a "Bateria" (Battery) with "Voltagem da bateria: '12V'". The Hazmat definition lists "Batteries (when sold separately)" and "18650 lithium battery 3.7V for flashlight" as Hazmat examples. However, this is a complete electronic device, and the type of 12V battery (e.g., small alkaline A23, which is not Hazmat in small quantities) is not specified. "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat, despite containing batteries. Without specific information indicating a hazardous battery type (like a large lithium-ion or lead-acid battery) or that the battery is meant to be sold separately, it aligns more with complete electronic devices.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** While it contains a battery, it's a complete electronic device. The definition's non-Hazmat examples include complete electronic devices like phones and computers, which also contain batteries. The Hazmat examples for batteries typically refer to them sold separately or specific types (like 18650 lithium). Assuming a standard small battery for a remote control, it does not meet the Hazmat criteria.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

Batch 34:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Title and Attributes:** For each product, I will examine its title and available attributes to understand its nature and composition.
2.  **Compare with Hazmat Definition:** I will then compare the product's characteristics against the "Definition of a Hazmat" and the "Examples of Hazmat and Reasons for Classification" provided. Key indicators for Hazmat include being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, as well as compressed gases/liquids or hot materials. The "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" lists will also be heavily referenced.
3.  **Determine Classification:**
    *   If the product clearly matches a Hazmat characteristic or example (e.g., explicitly stated as toxic, flammable, corrosive, or an aerosol), it will be classified as Hazmat.
    *   If the product falls under "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" (e.g., food, complete electronics, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care, furniture) and has no attributes suggesting a hazard, it will be classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   If there's ambiguity, but a strong indicator points to a hazard (e.g., explicit "toxic" attribute), it will be classified as Hazmat with appropriate confidence. If no clear indicator is present, and it seems like a general consumer item, it will be Non-Hazmat.

Batch 35:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I will strictly adhere to the provided definition, which classifies substances posing a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment based on characteristics like being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic. It also includes compressed gases/liquids or hot materials. The examples provided for each class (1-9) and the "HAZMAT Indicators" are crucial. Conversely, "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" will guide the non-hazardous classifications.

2.  **Analyze Each Product:** For each product, I will examine its title and attributes to identify key characteristics and materials.

3.  **Cross-Reference with Definition and Examples:**
    *   **"Estojo," "Caderno," "Livro," "Mochila," "Apagador," "Lápis," "Envelope," "Etiqueta"**: These are standard school/office supplies or personal items made of common materials (plastic, paper, fabric). They fall under "Office supplies," "Clothing & Textiles," or "Furniture & Home Goods," which are explicitly listed as NON-HAZMAT.
    *   **"Fitas Adesivas"**: Made of polypropylene or paper with acrylic adhesive. These are basic office supplies and not listed as Hazmat.
    *   **"Silicone Transparente Acético Vedação"**: The term "Acético" (acetic) indicates the release of acetic acid during curing. Acetic acid is corrosive/irritant. The Hazmat definition includes "corrosive substances" (Class 8). The "HAZMAT Indicators" also mention "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and "Automotive chemicals (paints, thinners, sealants)," which this product fits.
    *   **"Pincel Atômico Permanente Canetão Pilot"**: The attribute specifies "Tipo de tinta: À base de água" (Water-based ink). While "permanente" can sometimes imply solvents, the explicit "water-based" attribute means it does not contain flammable solvents like alcohol. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.
    *   **"Marca Texto Faber Castell Supersoft Ponta Em Gel" and "Canetas Permanentes [...] Ponta Dupla C/ Bolsa"**: Both explicitly state "Tipo de tinta: À base de álcool" (Alcohol-based ink). Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). Products containing flammable liquids are Hazmat.
    *   **"Marcadores Giz Liquido"**: These are liquid chalk markers. They typically use water-based or non-toxic formulations designed for easy erasing. There's no indication of flammable or toxic solvents.

4.  **Determine Confidence Level:**
    *   **High:** When the product clearly matches a Hazmat or Non-Hazmat example or principle from the definition.
    *   **Medium:** When there's a slight ambiguity but strong indicators point to one classification. (Not applicable in this set, as the classifications are quite clear).
    *   **Low:** When significant uncertainty exists based on the provided information. (Not applicable in this set).

The definition explicitly lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and "Automotive chemicals (paints, thinners, sealants)" as Hazmat indicators. While this is not automotive paint, "Tinta" (ink/paint) in a 500ml liquid volume, especially for whiteboard markers, is highly likely to contain flammable solvents (e.g., alcohol-based). Such a volume of a solvent-based ink would classify it as a Flammable Liquid (Class 3).

Batch 38:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Product 1: MLB44959669 - 5 Rolos Opcao Etiquetas 10x15 Cm Termica Serrilha Economy Cor Branco**
*   **Reasoning:** This product consists of thermal paper labels with adhesive. The material is paper, and the adhesive typically used for labels of this type is not considered a hazardous material (e.g., flammable, corrosive, toxic) according to the provided definition. It falls under general office or stationery supplies.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 2: MLB25837584 - Saco Plastico Envelope 24x33 0,06 A4 Ofício 100un Sem Furo**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a plastic envelope made of polypropylene. Polypropylene is a common, stable plastic material that does not exhibit any of the hazardous characteristics (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic) listed in the Hazmat definition. It is a basic office supply.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 3: MLB26236566 - Estilete De Precisao Aço Com 5 Refis**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a precision utility knife with steel blades. While sharp objects pose a physical hazard (cuts), the Hazmat definition specifically refers to "substance (solid, liquid, or gas) that poses a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment, even when not being transported," based on characteristics like flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, etc. A utility knife is a "Basic tool" and does not contain or consist of a hazardous substance in the context of this definition.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 4: MLB24307690 - Caixa Lápis De Cor 12 Cores Grande Leo Eco Atacado**

Without specific information indicating a hazardous ink, it's classified as a non-Hazmat "Office supply."

Batch 39:
## Hazmat Classification Reasoning Process:

For each product, I will analyze its title and attributes against the provided Hazmat definition and examples. The key indicators for Hazmat classification include:
*   **Chemical products:** acids, solvents, cleaners, industrial chemicals, reagents.
*   **Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers.**
*   **Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances.**
*   **Batteries (when sold separately).**
*   **Products requiring safety warnings.**

Non-Hazmat indicators include:
*   Food and beverages.
*   Complete electronic devices.
*   Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather).
*   Basic tools and hardware.
*   Office supplies.
*   Personal care items (non-aerosol).
*   Furniture and home goods.

I will specifically look for terms indicating flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, or if the product is a gas or contains a significant amount of solvent.

Here's the detailed reasoning for each product:

1.  **MLB21546416 - Suporte Carrinho Mochila G C/ Rodinha Silicone Escolar V Cor Preto**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a support trolley for a backpack, made of plastic and aluminum. It is a non-chemical, non-electronic, and non-hazardous physical item. It falls under general non-Hazmat categories like "Furniture & Home Goods" or "Basic tools and hardware" (if considering it a tool for transport).
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB26408300 - Caneta Marcadora Texta 700 Ponta Grossa 1.5mm 1un Vermelho**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a marker pen. While some markers can contain alcohol-based ink (which would be Hazmat), the attributes do not specify the type of ink. In the absence of information indicating a hazardous substance (like alcohol-based ink as seen in MLB30216105), it is considered a standard office supply, which is a non-Hazmat indicator. The definition lists "Caneta esferográfica" as non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB30216105 - Caneta Marcador Permanente Preto 2.0 Caixa C/ 5 Unidade**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a permanent marker. The attributes explicitly state "Tipo de tinta: À base de álcool". Alcohol is a flammable liquid, and the definition classifies flammable liquids (like Isopropyl alcohol) as Hazmat (Class 3).
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Contains alcohol-based ink, which is a flammable liquid.
    *   **Confidence:** High.

4.  **MLB21453611 - Papel Fotográfico 180g Glossy A4 À Prova D´água 100 Folhas Cor Branco**
    *   **Analysis:** This is photographic paper. Paper is a basic office supply and does not inherently possess hazardous characteristics according to the definition.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB21639190 - Papel Sulfite A4 75g Report Premium branco 500 folhas**
    *   **Analysis:** This is sulfite paper. The definition explicitly lists "A4 sulfite paper" as a non-Hazmat example under "Office Supplies."
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

6.  **MLB23791281 - Estojo Box Académie Preto - Tilibra**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a pencil case made of nylon. It is a standard school/office supply and does not contain any hazardous materials.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

7.  **MLB19427303 - Atlas geográfico escolar - Volume único, de Simielli, Maria Elena., vol. Único. Editorial Ática Didáticos, capa mole, 37ª edição em português, 2020**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a school atlas (book). Books are not classified as hazardous materials and fall under general office/school supplies.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

8.  **MLB50684600 - Caderno Diario Com Cadeado Senha 288 Paginas Pauta Pautado Cor Amarelo Diario com Segredo Fechadura para Proteção de Dados e Privacidade**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a notebook with a lock. It is a standard office/school supply and does not contain any hazardous materials.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

9.  **MLB45803621 - Estojo Box Académie Nylon Com Divisória Elástico Escolar Cor Preto**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a pencil case made of nylon. It is a standard school/office supply and does not contain any hazardous materials.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

11. **MLB38060369 - Kit Mickey Mouse Escolar Canetinha + Lápis De Cor Molin**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a school kit containing markers ("Canetinha") and colored pencils. Similar to other marker products where the ink type is not specified, and given it's a children's school kit, the inks are generally water-based or non-hazardous. It falls under "Office supplies" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

12. **MLB24790833 - Inkdraw Paper Para Impressora Transferir Tatuagem A4 50 Fls**
    *   **Analysis:** This is paper for tattoo transfer. While specialized, it is still paper and does not inherently possess hazardous characteristics.

    *   **Analysis:** These are painting canvases with wooden frames. They are basic art supplies and do not contain any hazardous materials.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

17. **MLB24059808 - Eucatex Peg & Pinte tinta acrílica antimofo 3.6L cor branco neve**
    *   **Analysis:** This is acrylic paint. The attributes explicitly state "É inflamável: Não". While paints can often be Hazmat (e.g., Class 3 Flammable Liquids), this product's explicit declaration of being non-flammable is a key factor in its classification as non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

18. **MLB43960800 - Kit Pintura Numerada Terapeutica - Lilo E Stitch Hawaii**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a paint-by-numbers kit. These kits typically contain small quantities of paints (often acrylic or water-based) that are generally considered non-hazardous for consumer use. No hazardous properties are indicated in the attributes.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

25. **MLB24628513 - Marcador de brinco Allflex Animal**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a permanent marker for animal ear tags. Similar to other permanent markers (like MLB30216105), permanent inks often contain solvents (e.g., alcohol) to achieve their permanence. While the specific ink composition isn't detailed, the "permanent" nature implies chemical properties that could be hazardous (e.g., flammability from solvents). The definition lists "Chemical products" as a Hazmat indicator. Without explicit confirmation of non-hazardous properties, it's safer to classify it as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Permanent markers often contain flammable solvents, classifying them as chemical products with potential hazards.
    *   **Confidence:** Medium.

26. **MLB39196570 - Kit Maleta Escolar Pintura 68 Peças Canetinha Estojo Meninas**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a school painting kit with markers ("Canetinha") and pencils. Similar to other children's art kits, the materials are generally presumed to be non-hazardous for consumer use unless specified otherwise. It falls under "Office supplies" or general non-chemical items.

29. **MLB37818931 - Tinta Preta Para Almofada De Carimbo 40ml - 2 Unidades Cor Preto**
    *   **Analysis:** This is stamp ink. Inks are chemical products, and many inks, especially for stamp pads, contain solvents that can be flammable or irritating. The definition lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as a Hazmat indicator. Without information specifying it as water-based or non-hazardous, it's prudent to classify it as Hazmat due to the potential presence of flammable/toxic solvents.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Ink is a chemical product that can contain flammable or toxic solvents, and its specific composition is not provided to confirm it's non-hazardous.
    *   **Confidence:** Medium.

30. **MLB36253000 - Cola Universal Pegamil Cola Universal de 17g Transparente Ideal para Artesanato Hobbies Pequenos Reparos**
    *   **Analysis:** This is universal glue. While the attributes state "É tóxico: Não", many universal glues contain flammable solvents (e.g., acetone, ethyl acetate) which are classified as flammable liquids (Class 3). "Non-toxic" generally refers to oral toxicity and does not necessarily imply non-flammable or safe for inhalation of vapors. The definition lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as a Hazmat indicator. Given the common composition of universal glues, it likely contains flammable solvents.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Universal glues often contain flammable solvents, which are chemical products classified as Hazmat (Class 3: Flammable Liquids).
    *   **Confidence:** Medium.

Batch 40:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Product 1: MLB38030540 - Tinta Para Carimbo 1 Litro Preto Radex**
*   **Reasoning:** The product is "Tinta Para Carimbo" (Stamp Ink). Inks are chemical products and often contain solvents that can be flammable or irritating. The Hazmat definition includes "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and lists "White synthetic enamel paint" as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid Hazmat. While stamp ink isn't automotive paint, it shares characteristics with paints in being a chemical liquid that may contain hazardous solvents. Without specific information on its flash point or exact chemical composition, the potential for it to be flammable or irritating due to its solvent content makes it fall under the Hazmat category as a chemical product.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat
*   **Confidence:** Medium

**Product 2: MLB24226718 - Marcador P/ Quadro Branco Pilot V-board Master Cor Laranja**
*   **Reasoning:** The product is a "Marcador P/ Quadro Branco" (Whiteboard Marker). The definition provides an example of "Kit Pincel Caneta P/ Quadro Branco" as a non-Hazmat item. While some whiteboard markers can be alcohol-based (flammable), this product's "Tipo de tinta" is specified as 'Pigmentada', and there is no explicit mention of it being alcohol-based or flammable. Given the direct non-Hazmat example of a whiteboard marker kit, and the lack of specific hazardous properties, it's classified as non-Hazmat.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat
*   **Confidence:** High

**Product 3: MLB47419691 - Construir Juntos Ensino Religioso 1º Ano, De Vários Autores. Editorial Edicoes Sm Didatico, Capa Mole, Edição 20230101 00:00:00 Em**

The glue gun is an electronic device, and the glue sticks are solid, non-toxic, and typically non-flammable in their solid state. When melted, they are hot, but the "hot materials" classification in the definition refers to materials that are inherently hazardous due to high temperature during transport, not items that become hot during normal operation. The product falls under "Basic tools and hardware" or "Office supplies" which are non-Hazmat indicators.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat
*   **Confidence:** High

**Product 5: MLB32011245 - LU Fita corretiva 5mx5mm Plástico escolar branquinho 6 peças**

*   **Confidence:** High

**Product 13: MLB45286727 - Silicone Acético Transparente Adesivo Selagem Pias Vasos Box Banheiros Portas Janelas Tek Bond 270ml**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is "Silicone Acético Transparente Adesivo Selagem" (Transparent Acetic Silicone Adhesive Sealant). Acetic silicone is a chemical product that releases acetic acid during its curing process. Acetic acid is a corrosive substance (Class 8: Corrosive Substances, e.g., Sulfuric acid, Hydrochloric acid). While the product states "É tóxico: Não", this refers specifically to toxicity, not necessarily corrosivity or other hazards. The release of corrosive vapors during use aligns with the Hazmat definition of a substance posing a risk to health (e.g., irritation) due to its chemical properties. The definition also lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators.

Alcohol-based inks contain flammable solvents.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat

Batch 42:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **MLB22549919 - 10 X Pasta Aba Com Elastico Documento Oficio A4 Escritorio Cores Transparente**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a set of folders made of "Polipropileno" (Polypropylene), a common plastic used for office supplies.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Polypropylene in this form does not exhibit any hazardous characteristics such as being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic. It is a finished, inert office item.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** The definition lists "Office Supplies" as a non-Hazmat indicator, with "A4 sulfite paper" and "Metal stapler" as examples. This product fits within this category.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB24702696 - 12 Fita Corretivas 3 Metros Escritorio Branquinho Escolar**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a kit of correction tapes. The attributes mention "Tipo de corretor: Fita 5MM" and "É á base d\'água": 'Não'. It's a tape, not a liquid correction fluid.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Correction tape, in its solid tape form, does not typically contain substances that pose a significant risk to health, safety, property, or the environment as defined for Hazmat classification. The small "Volume líquido: 1 mL" if referring to any component, is likely negligible or non-hazardous.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This falls under "Office Supplies," which is a non-Hazmat category.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB27419742 - Estojo Box Luluca Meninas Juvenil Escolar Holográfico Clio Cor Pvc/holográfica**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a pencil case made of "PVCHOLOGRÁFICA" (PVC/Holographic material).
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) is a common plastic material. In its solid, finished product form, it is not classified as hazardous according to the provided definition. It does not possess any of the listed hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This fits into the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Furniture & Home Goods," which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB24686747 - Kit 10 Colas Adesivo Instantâneo 100g Tekbond 793**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a kit of "Adesivo Instantâneo" (instant adhesive/glue) in liquid form. While the attribute "É tóxico: Não" is present, instant adhesives are chemical products.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The definition explicitly lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Instant adhesives (e.g., cyanoacrylates) are chemical substances that can cause irritation to skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and can bond skin instantly, posing a direct safety risk. Even if not acutely "toxic" in the Class 6 sense, they pose a risk to health and safety.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** The classification includes "Chemical products" as a general Hazmat indicator. This product is a chemical adhesive.
    *   **Conclusion:** Hazmat.

5.  **MLB22704230 - Estojo Escolar 2 compartimentos Minions**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a pencil case made of "Poliéster" (Polyester).
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Polyester is a common fabric/material. In its finished product form, it is not considered hazardous according to the provided definition. It does not possess any of the listed hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This fits into the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles," which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

6.  **MLB36371800 - Fita Adesiva Silver Tape Reforçada 48mm X 5m Cor Vermelho**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a roll of adhesive tape made with "Borracha" (Rubber) as a material.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Adhesive tape, in its solid form, does not contain substances that pose a significant risk (flammable, toxic, corrosive, etc.) as defined for Hazmat classification. Rubber in this form is also not hazardous.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This falls under "Basic tools and hardware" or "Office supplies," which are non-Hazmat categories.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

7.  **MLB24448631 - Lápis De Cor 24 Cores Supersoft Faber Castell Aquarela**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a set of colored pencils.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Standard colored pencils are generally considered non-toxic and do not pose any of the specific hazards listed in the Hazmat definition (e.g., flammability, corrosivity, severe toxicity). The "aquarela" (watercolor) aspect refers to the pigment properties, not a hazardous liquid.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** "Basic tools and hardware" and "Office supplies" are non-Hazmat indicators. This product aligns with these categories.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

8.  **MLB28128731 - Caneta Bic Cristal Ponta Fina 0.8mm Azul Caixa C/ 25 Cor do exterior Transparente**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a box of ballpoint pens with "a base de corante" (dye-based) ink.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** The ink in standard ballpoint pens is not considered a hazardous material in the small quantities contained within the pen. It does not pose risks like flammability, corrosivity, or severe toxicity.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** "Blue ballpoint pen Bic crystal" is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat example under "Office Supplies."
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

9.  **MLB21769934 - Mochila de Viagem para Notebook 17 Polegadas Escolar Masculina 50L Mochila Escolar Impermeável para Adulto Trabalho RS-A1 Yorepek Cor Preta Lisa**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a backpack made of "Poliéster." It mentions a "Com entrada USB," which typically refers to a pass-through port, not an integrated power bank or battery.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Polyester is a common fabric/material and is not considered hazardous. A backpack itself does not possess any of the hazardous characteristics. The USB port is a passive component, not a battery that would make it Hazmat.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This fits into "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods," which are non-Hazmat categories. "Complete electronic devices" are non-Hazmat, and this is an accessory.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

10. **MLB25733600 - Régua De Metal Aço Inox 1 Metro Para Artesanato Nybc**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a ruler made of "Aço" (Steel).
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Steel is a metal that, in the form of a ruler, is inert and does not pose any hazardous risks as defined. It is not flammable, corrosive, toxic, etc.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** "Basic tools and hardware" are listed as non-Hazmat. A ruler fits this category.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

11. **MLB24206745 - Bobina Térmica 80x30 Pdv Cx 30 Unidades Cor Amarelo Adegraf**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a box of thermal paper rolls.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** While thermal paper can contain chemicals like BPA or BPS, these are generally not considered Hazmat for transport purposes in the context of the provided definition. The definition's examples for "toxic" are much more acutely hazardous (e.g., potassium cyanide, pesticides). Thermal paper is widely used and typically not regulated as a hazardous material for shipping.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** "A4 sulfite paper" is listed as non-Hazmat under "Office Supplies." Thermal paper, while chemically treated, is similar in its common usage and regulatory status for transport.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

12. **MLB28294602 - Mochila KARGA 25 Litros Fighter 3**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a backpack made of "Hydro Nylon."
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Nylon is a common fabric/material and is not considered hazardous in its finished product form. It does not possess any of the listed hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** This fits into "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods," which are non-Hazmat categories.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

13. **MLB27047485 - Carga Crown Azul Preta Esferográfica Cross Ca12009**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a pen refill with "Líquida" (liquid) ink.
    *   **Hazmat Definition Check:** Similar to complete pens, the ink in pen refills is not considered a hazardous material in the small quantities contained. It does not pose risks like flammability, corrosivity, or severe toxicity.
    *   **Examples Cross-reference:** "Blue ballpoint pen Bic crystal" is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat example under "Office Supplies." A refill is essentially the same ink.

Batch 43:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product by examining its title and attributes to identify its nature and components. Then, I will compare these characteristics against the provided Hazmat definition, its nine classes of hazardous materials, and the explicit examples of both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods. My primary focus will be to determine if any product falls into categories like explosives, gases, flammable liquids/solids, oxidizing agents, toxic/infectious substances, radioactive substances, corrosive substances, or miscellaneous hazardous substances (e.g., asbestos, lithium batteries sold separately). I will also leverage the "Non-Hazmat Indicators" such as "Office supplies," "Complete electronic devices," "Natural materials," "Basic tools and hardware," and "Personal care items (non-aerosol)" to confirm non-hazardous classifications.

For products like pens and art kits containing inks or glues, I will assess if the type and quantity of these substances pose a significant risk according to the Hazmat definition. Generally, common school/office supplies with small, contained amounts of water-based or pigment-based inks/glues are not classified as Hazmat unless they contain specific hazardous solvents or chemicals in concentrations that would trigger a classification.

Here's the detailed analysis for each product:

1.  **MLB45358214 - Estojo Escolar Infantil Estampa Games Jogos Estojo Roblox:** This is a pencil case made of nylon, a common school supply. It does not contain any hazardous materials.

The small quantity of ink contained within pens does not pose a significant hazard as defined for flammable liquids or toxic substances (e.g., gasoline, industrial solvents, pesticides).

18. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB29161377**
    *   **TITLE:** Tek Bond Adesivo Araldite Hobby 23g
    *   **Analysis:** This product is an "Adesivo Araldite" (Araldite adhesive), which is a type of epoxy adhesive. The attributes state "Tipo de cola: adesivo epoxi" and "É tóxico: Não". While it's explicitly stated as non-toxic, the Hazmat definition lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as general HAZMAT indicators. Adhesives are chemical products. Even if not toxic, two-part epoxy systems can involve components that are irritants, sensitizers, or have a flash point making them flammable, even if not explicitly stated. The definition states a Hazmat "poses a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment". Given it's a chemical adhesive, it's safer to classify it as Hazmat due to potential chemical risks not fully negated by "não tóxico".
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** As a chemical adhesive (epoxy), it falls under the general category of "Chemical products" which are HAZMAT indicators, potentially posing risks such as irritation or flammability, even if not explicitly labeled as toxic in all aspects.
    *   **Confidence:** Medium.

Batch 45:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **MLB28898723 - Estojo Grande Escolar Espaçoso 3 Divisórias Masculino Jumbo Cor Preto Liso**
    *   This product is a school pencil case made of polyester. It is a common school supply and does not contain any chemical, flammable, explosive, corrosive, or other hazardous materials. It falls under the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles" (similar to a bag), which are listed as non-Hazmat indicators.

2.  **MLB39870713 - Bloco Comanda Bar Restaurante Anotação 10x7cm 100 Fl-50 Unds**
    *   This product is a block of paper for notes. Paper products are generally considered non-Hazmat and are consistent with "Office supplies" in the non-Hazmat indicators.

3.  **MLB22217230 - A caixa de Jéssica Peter Carnavas Editora FTD Educação Capa mole Português**
    *   This product is a book. Books are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat examples in the provided definition (e.g., "A4 sulfite paper" implies paper products including books).

4.  **MLB24043318 - Papel Fotográfico Adesivo A4 Glossy 115g 100 Un. Masterprint Cor Branco**
    *   This product is photographic adhesive paper. While it has an adhesive, the primary component is paper, and the adhesive type is not specified as hazardous (e.g., highly flammable, corrosive). It's a common office/craft supply and does not meet the criteria for any Hazmat class.

5.  **MLB26958031 - Cola Instantânea 793 Tekbond 100g**
    *   This product is "Instant Glue" (Cola Instantânea), commonly known as Super Bonder. Instant glues, such as those containing cyanoacrylate, are chemical products. Despite the attribute "É tóxico: Não", many instant glues are known to be irritants to skin, eyes, and respiratory system, and some may have flammable components or flash points that classify them as hazardous materials (e.g., Class 3 Flammable Liquids or Class 6 Toxic Substances due to irritation/harmful effects). The definition includes "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and "Toxic substances harmful to human health" as Hazmat indicators. Given the general properties of instant glues, it poses a risk to health.

6.  **MLB27594005 - Milheiro Etiqueta Adesiva Frágil 100x50 Cor Vermelho**
    *   This product consists of adhesive labels made of Couché paper. Similar to other paper-based adhesive products, the material itself and the adhesive are not specified as hazardous. It is an office/packaging supply.

7.  **MLB22658297 - Estojo Escolar 01 Divisória Academie Preto Tilibra**
    *   This product is a school pencil case made of polyester. It is a common school supply and does not contain any hazardous materials. It falls under the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles" (similar to a bag), which are listed as non-Hazmat indicators.

8.  **MLB27703995 - Kit 5 Fita Adesiva Kraft Embalagem Papel Crepado 45mm X 50m Cor Marrom Liso**
    *   This product is Kraft adhesive tape. The primary material is paper (Kraft), and the adhesive is not specified as hazardous. It is a basic office/packaging supply and does not meet Hazmat criteria.

9.  **MLB25681926 - Marcador P/ Retroprojetor Pilot 2.0 Preto - Cx C/ 12**
    *   This product is a permanent marker with "À base de álcool" (alcohol-based ink). Alcohol is explicitly listed as a component of flammable liquids (Class 3) in the Hazmat definition examples (e.g., "Alcohol isopropílico"). Therefore, this product contains a flammable liquid.

10. **MLB26708166 - Estojo Liso Com 2 Divisórias C/alça Box Necessaire Escolar Cor Cinza**
    *   This product is a school pencil case made of polyester. It is a common school supply and does not contain any hazardous materials. It falls under the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles" (similar to a bag), which are listed as non-Hazmat indicators.

11. **MLB19427351 - Livro ziguezague caligrafia 3º ano 3ª edição português editora scipione Capa Mole**
    *   This product is a book. Books are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat examples in the provided definition.

12. **MLB22771600 - Caderno Universitário Capa Dura 96fls Quadriculado 1x1cm - Spiral**
    *   This product is a notebook. Paper products are generally considered non-Hazmat and are consistent with "Office supplies" in the non-Hazmat indicators.

13. **MLB24314295 - Borracha Limpa Tipos Sinoart**
    *   This product is an eraser made of rubber. Rubber in this form is a non-hazardous material. It falls under "Office Supplies" or "Basic tools and hardware" (as a simple tool), which are non-Hazmat indicators.

14. **MLB43416711 - Mochila Rodinha Infantil Escolar Feminina Menina Com Cor Lilo Stitch Desenho**
    *   This product is a school backpack made of nylon and polyethylene. It does not contain any hazardous materials and falls under categories like "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" (as a container/bag), which are non-Hazmat indicators.

15. **MLB43487440 - Estojo 1 Divisória Fluffy Pelúcia Ursinho Pooh Descanso Dac**
    *   This product is a pencil case made of plush material. It is a common school supply and does not contain any hazardous materials. It falls under the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles", which are listed as non-Hazmat indicators.

16. **MLB36954557 - Inovar Metais 72 organizador rosa 20x19.5cm**
    *   This product is an organizer made of polyester. It is a general office/home good and does not contain any hazardous materials.

17. **MLB36945619 - Esteira De Corte Silhouette Cameo 30x30 C/cola 05pçs**
    *   This product is a cutting mat with adhesive. The material is "ADESIVA" (adhesive). Similar to other adhesive products, the adhesive is not specified as hazardous, and the item itself is a tool/material, not a chemical product with inherent hazards.

18. **MLB31055272 - Estilete Profissional Largo 25mm Empunhadura Emborrachada Trava Lâmina Reforçado**
    *   This product is a utility knife (estilete). While it has a sharp blade that can cause injury, the Hazmat definition focuses on risks from the material's inherent hazardous characteristics (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, toxic, etc.), not mechanical injury from a sharp object. It falls under "Basic tools and hardware (Non-Chemical)", which is a non-Hazmat indicator.

19. **MLB43184347 - Durepóxi Adesivo Epóxi Massa Loctite 100g Henkel Cor Cinza**
    *   This product is "Epoxy Adhesive Mass" (Durepóxi Adesivo Epóxi Massa). Epoxy adhesives are chemical products, typically comprising resins and hardeners that can be irritating or sensitizing before curing. While the attribute states "É tóxico: Não", epoxies often carry safety warnings due to skin/eye irritation and potential sensitization, fitting the Hazmat definition of posing a risk to health or being "harmful to human health" (Class 6 or Class 9).

20. **MLB48883048 - 36 Canetinhas Coloridas Com Duas Pontas diversas cores**
    *   This product is a set of colored markers with "À base de água" (water-based ink). Water-based inks are generally non-hazardous and do not contain flammable solvents, unlike alcohol-based inks.

25. **MLB34004957 - Semear Juntos - Ensino Religioso - 4 Ano - 3 Ed. 2024, De Desenvolvida E Produzida Por Edições Sm Obra Colet. Editora Sm, Capa Mole, Edição 3 Em Português, 2024**

30. **MLB27906352 - Calculadora Científica Casio Fx-82ms 2nd Edition Com 240 Funções Segunda Edição S-V.P.A.M. Acompanha Capa Cor Preto**

Batch 46:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product by evaluating its title and attributes against the provided Hazmat definition, which categorizes hazardous materials into nine classes (explosives, gases, flammable liquids, flammable solids, oxidizing agents, toxic/infectious substances, radioactive substances, corrosive substances, and miscellaneous hazardous substances). I will also refer to the explicit examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat items and the key classification principles.

For each product, I will consider:
1.  **Material Composition:** What is the product made of? Are these materials inherently hazardous?
2.  **Function/Purpose:** What is the product used for? Does its use imply the presence of hazardous substances (e.g., chemicals, fuels, pressurized gases)?
3.  **Explicit Attributes:** Are there any attributes (e.g., "É tóxico: Não", "Tipo de tinta: À base de corantes orgânicos e solventes") that provide direct clues about its hazardous nature or lack thereof?
4.  **Comparison to Examples:** Does it resemble any of the Hazmat examples (e.g., spray paint, industrial chemicals, strong acids) or non-Hazmat examples (e.g., complete electronic devices, office supplies, food)?

Based on this, here's the analysis for each product:

*   **MLB45432499: Estojo Escolar Triplo Barbie 3 Divisórias Cor Modelo 2**
    *   Analysis: This is a school pencil case made of PVC. It is a common school supply and does not contain any substances classified as hazardous according to the definition (no flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, etc.). It falls under the general category of "Office Supplies" or "Furniture & Home Goods" which are indicated as non-Hazmat.
    *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

*   **MLB44551762: Maleta Escolar Desenho Pintura Perfeita Artista 208 Pçs**
    *   Analysis: This is a school art and painting kit. While some art supplies can be hazardous (e.g., specific paints with heavy metals, strong solvents), the description only mentions "lápis" (pencils) and "borracha plástica" (plastic eraser). There is no indication of flammable liquids, aerosols, or toxic pigments. It's a general school supply kit.
    *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

*   **MLB34083111: Livro Caixa Oficio Capa Dura 100 Folhas Grande 215mm X 315mm**

    *   Analysis: This is a box of 50 ballpoint pens. The ink is described as "À base de corantes orgânicos e solventes" (Based on organic dyes and solvents). However, standard ballpoint pen ink, even with solvents, is not typically concentrated or volatile enough to be classified as a flammable liquid (Class 3) or toxic substance (Class 6) in the context of Hazmat for transport. The non-Hazmat examples explicitly include "Caneta esferográfica azul Bic cristal", which is the same type of product.
    *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   Analysis: This is a kit of transparent adhesive tape. While it contains an adhesive, standard adhesive tapes are not classified as Hazmat. The adhesive is not present in a form or concentration that would pose a significant risk of flammability, toxicity, or corrosivity.
    *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

*   **MLB40299796: Cola Adesivo Vinil Sem Tolueno Para Pvc Flexível Colagem Infláveis Piscinas Barracas Lonas 75gr Brascola**
    *   Analysis: This is a vinyl adhesive glue. It explicitly states "Sem Tolueno" (Toluene-free) and "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No). While it is a chemical product, the explicit declaration of "non-toxic" and "toluene-free" (toluene being a hazardous solvent) strongly indicates it's formulated to be non-hazardous. There is no information suggesting it is flammable or possesses other Hazmat characteristics.
    *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

Batch 47:
**Reasoning Process:**

For each product, I will assess whether it meets the definition of a Hazmat by checking its characteristics against the provided Hazmat classification criteria (flammable, explosive, corrosive, toxic, oxidizing, gases, radioactive, etc.) and the examples of both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods.

1.  **MLB38689862: 10x Rolo Bobina 2000 Senhas 3 Dígitos Preferencial Azul**
    *   This product is a paper roll for queue management. Paper is explicitly mentioned as a material for non-Hazmat items (e.g., "A4 sulfite paper"). It does not possess any hazardous characteristics like flammability, toxicity, or corrosivity.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB32554660: Kit Face Spider-man Molin Homem-aranha 7 Peças - Escolar**
    *   This is a school kit, likely containing common stationery items such as pencils and erasers, as indicated by the attributes. These items fall under "Office Supplies," which is a non-Hazmat indicator. There is no information suggesting the presence of hazardous materials like strong chemicals, aerosols, or flammable components.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB50203828: Estojo De Papelaria Elegante Capivara Porta-lápis Cor Marrom-claro**
    *   This is a pencil case made of polyester. It is a common office/school supply item. There are no hazardous characteristics associated with this product.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB44494147: Estojo Minecraft 2 Compartimentos Colorido Sestini Preto**
    *   This is a pencil case made of polyester, similar to MLB50203828. It is a common office/school supply item and does not possess any hazardous characteristics.

6.  **MLB22380667: Historia, Sociedade E Cidadania V4 9 Ano La**
    *   This product is a school book. Similar to MLB19391588, books are generally non-Hazmat and fall under "Office Supplies".
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

7.  **MLB19816480: No Capricho B Caligrafia Integrada Renovada**

    *   This is a large school art kit containing items like markers, crayons, colored pencils, watercolor paint, and glue. While paints and glues *can* be Hazmat, the "Tinta Aquarela" (watercolor paint) and typical school glues are water-based and non-toxic, distinct from the flammable or lead-based paints listed as Hazmat examples. The overall nature of a "school kit" implies safety for children's use. It primarily consists of "Office Supplies".
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

9.  **MLB32904245: Tinta Marcador Quadro Branco Reabastecedor 500ml Azul**
    *   This product is a 500ml refill ink for whiteboard markers. Whiteboard marker inks commonly contain flammable solvents (e.g., alcohol). The definition lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and "Flammable Liquids" as Hazmat indicators. Given the volume and the common composition of whiteboard inks, it is highly likely to be flammable.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Contains liquid ink, which often includes flammable solvents (e.g., alcohol) making it a Flammable Liquid (Class 3).
    *   **Confidence:** High.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

13. **MLB26891068: Cola Líquido Almaflex 5 Kg de 5kg**
    *   This is 5kg of liquid glue. The attributes explicitly state "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No). While it is a chemical product, its explicit non-toxic nature, combined with no indication of flammability or corrosivity (which are common hazards for liquid chemicals), leads to a non-Hazmat classification. Common liquid glues for general use are often water-based and non-hazardous.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

14. **MLB32162221: Pasta Suspensa Kraft Sem Acessórios 180gm 50 Unidades**
    *   This product is a set of hanging folders made of cardboard. These are standard "Office Supplies" and do not contain hazardous materials.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

18. **MLB25262910: Estojo Caneta Posca Marcador Permanente Ponta 5m - 8 Cores**
    *   This product contains permanent markers. Crucially, the attributes state "Tipo de tinta: À base de água" (Water-based ink). Water-based inks are generally non-flammable and non-toxic, unlike solvent-based inks often found in permanent markers. Therefore, these markers do not pose a Hazmat risk. They fall under "Office Supplies".
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

19. **MLB23856442: Caderno Livro Ponto Funcionários Empregadas Domésticas 160fl**

20. **MLB44937699: 9 Canetas Colorida Para Quadro Branco Com Apagador**

Whiteboard markers commonly use alcohol-based inks, which are flammable. As a chemical product potentially containing flammable solvents, it aligns with Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Contains liquid ink, commonly alcohol-based, making it a potential Flammable Liquid (Class 3).
    *   **Confidence:** Medium.

21. **MLB23417927: Swissport Bolsa Masculino Antifurto Saida USB Impermeável Moderna Escolar Faculdade Ejecutiva Negro Mochilas**

Batch 48:
Detailed reasoning process:

1.  **MLB36563372 - 40 Cxs Massinha De Modelar 6 Cor Escolar Infantil Atacado**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is modeling clay for children. The attributes explicitly state "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No). It falls under general school supplies.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** The definition classifies Hazmat based on characteristics like being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic. Since the product is explicitly stated as non-toxic and is a common art/school supply for children, it does not fit any of these hazardous categories. It is not an aerosol or a chemical product in a hazardous sense.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB28517790 - Livro Movimento De Caixa Grande 100 Folhas Tilibra**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a large ledger book.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Books are explicitly listed as "Office Supplies" which are indicators for "NON-HAZMAT" in the provided definition. There are no hazardous characteristics associated with a ledger book.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB25434843 - Kit 4 Cadernos 10 Matérias 160fls Espiral Capa Dura Universitário ZIP Tilibra - Preto**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a kit of four spiral-bound notebooks.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Notebooks are basic office/school supplies and are explicitly listed as "Office Supplies" which are indicators for "NON-HAZMAT". They do not possess any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB45819038 - Kitconjunto Canetas Marcador Permanente Ponta Dupla 262 Cor**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a kit of 262 permanent dual-tip marker pens. The attributes specify "Tipo de marcador: À base de álcool" (Type of marker: Alcohol-based) and "Tipo de tinta: À base de álcool" (Type of ink: Alcohol-based).
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). The definition includes "Flammable Liquids" and "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Alcohol-based inks contain solvents that are flammable, even if the quantity per pen is small, the bulk quantity of 262 pens would likely aggregate to a significant flammable hazard.
    *   **Conclusion:** Hazmat.

5.  **MLB40152304 - Literatura Infantil - Qual A Cor Do Abraço?, De Sami Ribeiro., Vol. 1. Editorial Ciranda Na Escola, Capa Brochura Em Português**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a children's literature book.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Books are explicitly listed as "Office Supplies" which are indicators for "NON-HAZMAT". There are no hazardous characteristics associated with a children's book.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

6.  **MLB27577253 - 50 Fitas Adesiva Transparente 48 Mm X 100 Metros**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a pack of 50 rolls of transparent adhesive tape, made of polypropylene.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Adhesive tape is a basic office/packaging supply. While adhesives contain chemicals, standard transparent tape is not typically classified as Hazmat unless it contains significant quantities of highly flammable, corrosive, or toxic solvents, which is not indicated for this common product.

Batch 49:
Detailed Reasoning Process:

1.  **Analyze Hazmat Definition and Examples:** I will refer to the provided Hazmat definition, paying close attention to the nine classes of hazardous materials (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious, Radioactive, Corrosive, Miscellaneous). I will also consider the explicit examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat items provided in the definition. Key indicators for Hazmat include chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners), aerosol sprays, pressurized containers, automotive chemicals, industrial chemicals, batteries (sold separately), and substances that are flammable, corrosive, or toxic. Non-Hazmat indicators include food, complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, and furniture/home goods.

2.  **Product by Product Classification:**

    *   **MLB26719895 - 30 Rolos Bobina Térmica Autopel 80x30 30m Cor Branco:** This product is thermal paper rolls. Paper is a common office supply and does not possess any hazardous characteristics like flammability (beyond normal combustible materials), toxicity, corrosivity, or explosivity. It falls under the general category of "Office supplies" which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB48928301 - Kit 3 Apagador De Quadro Branco Vidro Magnético Lousa Escola Gurumania:** This is a whiteboard eraser made of plastic. It is a standard office/school supply item. It does not contain any hazardous chemicals, gases, or materials. It falls under "Office supplies" (non-Hazmat).
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB22987811 - Caneta Crown Esfero Hawai Preta Yw10089p Cor da tinta Azul Cor do exterior Preto:** This is a ballpoint pen with oil-based ink. While ink contains solvents, the quantity in a single pen is minimal and poses no significant risk. The definition explicitly lists "Blue ballpoint pen Bic crystal" as non-Hazmat. This product is comparable.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB26632373 - Pincel Marcador P/ Quadro Branco Pilot Board Master Vermelho:** This is a whiteboard marker. Markers typically contain alcohol-based inks, which can be flammable. However, for a single consumer-grade marker, the volume of flammable liquid is very small and usually below the threshold for Hazmat classification. It falls under "Office supplies" which are generally non-Hazmat, unless there's an explicit indication of a high volume of highly flammable content.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB41594767 - Caneta Gel Retrátil Energel X Preta 1.0mm Bl110 - Pentel Tinta Preto:** This is a gel pen. Similar to ballpoint pens, it contains a small amount of ink. It is a standard office supply item and does not meet the criteria for any Hazmat class.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB38280629 - Cola Super Bonder Power Flex Gel Flexível Extra Forte Loctite 2g:** This is a 2g tube of "Super Bonder" (cyanoacrylate adhesive). While such glues bond quickly and can cause irritation, the product attributes explicitly state "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No). There is no indication of flammability or corrosivity for this specific product or quantity that would classify it as Hazmat according to the provided definition. Consumer-grade glues in small quantities are generally not Hazmat.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB24226746 - Pincel Marcador Quadro Branco Compactor Caixa C/12 Un Cor Azul:** This is a box of 12 whiteboard markers. Similar to a single marker (Product MLB26632373). While markers can contain flammable solvents, a consumer box of 12 units is generally not regulated as Hazmat due to the small volume per unit and overall contained nature, unless specific hazardous properties (like a very low flash point or high volume of flammable liquid) are indicated, which they are not here. It falls under "Office supplies" (non-Hazmat).
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB40929551 - Kit Zeus Escolar Menino Maleta Pintura 150 Peças Mundo Do Dinossauro Jurassic Park Estúdio Colorir Canetinha Giz Cera Lápis Cor Tinta Apontador Cola Tesoura Régua Clips Pincel Material Escola:** This is a comprehensive school art kit. It includes "Tinta" (paint) and "Cola" (glue). For a children's school kit, paints are typically water-based or non-toxic (e.g., tempera, watercolor), and glues are non-hazardous. The definition lists "White synthetic enamel paint" as Hazmat, but this is a specific industrial/automotive type, not a general "paint" in a children's kit. Without specific hazardous properties mentioned for the included "Tinta" or "Cola", and given it's a "school kit," it's assumed to be non-hazardous.
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB27825189 - Caneta Hidrocor Canetinha 36 Cores Giotto Turbo Color:** These are water-based markers ("Caneta Hidrocor"). The attribute "Tipo de tinta: À base de água" confirms they are water-based. Water-based inks are not flammable or toxic, and thus these markers are not Hazmat. They fall under "Office supplies" (non-Hazmat).
        *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

    *   **MLB41655685 - Caderno Inteligente Medio Hello Kitty Cor Rosa:** This is a notebook. Paper products are standard office/school supplies and are non-Hazmat. "A4 sulfite paper" is listed as non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB28461166 - 6 Marca Texto Neon + 6 Marca Texto Pastel Masterprint Mp 612:** These are highlighters with water-based ink. The attribute "Tipo de tinta: À base de água" confirms they are water-based. Water-based inks are not flammable or toxic, and thus these markers are not Hazmat.

Batch 50:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **MLB50481216: Mochila Masculina Speedo Escolar Faculdade Resistente Cor Preto**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a backpack made of polyester. It falls under general consumer goods or "Clothing & Textiles" / "Furniture & Home Goods" as per the non-Hazmat indicators. It does not possess any hazardous characteristics such as being flammable, corrosive, toxic, or containing compressed gases, nor is it a chemical, battery, or aerosol.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB28081876: Kit C/12 Glitter Purpurina Colorido Em Pó Cada Contém 3g Cor Pacote sortido**
    *   **Reasoning:** Glitter is typically made from plastic (e.g., PET) or aluminum. While fine powders can have specific handling requirements in industrial settings (e.g., dust explosion risk), consumer-grade glitter in small quantities (3g units) is not generally classified as a flammable solid, toxic, or allergenic material that poses a significant risk to health, safety, property, or the environment under normal transport conditions. The Hazmat definition's examples of flammable solids (e.g., Nitrocellulose, Magnesium, White phosphorus) are much more reactive.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB24376195: Caixa 72 Lápis Escrever Decorado Astronauta Com Borracha**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product consists of graphite pencils and erasers. These are standard "Office Supplies" as per the non-Hazmat indicators. Graphite is a stable form of carbon and is not considered hazardous in this consumer product form. Erasers are typically made of rubber or plastic and are not hazardous.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB19398975: Dicionário escolar Português/ Inglês, de Cultural, Ciranda. Dicionário Editorial Ciranda Cultural Editora E Distribuidora Ltda., capa mole em português, 2021**

Pencils, sharpeners, erasers, and scissors are basic "Office Supplies" or "Basic Tools & Hardware" and are non-hazardous. The "Cola" (glue) in a typical school kit is overwhelmingly likely to be a non-toxic, water-based glue (e.g., PVA glue), which is not classified as a Hazmat. The Hazmat definition specifies more potent chemical products like solvents or industrial chemicals, which are not characteristic of standard school glues.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

9.  **MLB25734999: Fita De Empacotamento 3m Scotch 5802 45mm X 100m 4 Rolos**

All these items, when intended for children's use, are manufactured to be non-toxic and non-hazardous. The "Tinta" (paint) in such a kit is highly likely to be water-based and child-safe, not a flammable or toxic chemical like those listed as Hazmat examples (e.g., paint thinner). The "Cola" (glue) is also assumed to be a standard, non-hazardous school glue.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

19. **MLB25481969: Billions Of Locusts, De Donaldo Buchweitz. Editora Ciranda Na Escola, Capa Mole Em Inglês**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a book. Books are classified under "Office Supplies" as per the non-Hazmat indicators.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

22. **MLB24105329: Kit 04 Caneta Marca Texto Cera Gel Não Mancha Brw**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a kit of gel wax highlighters. Highlighters are standard "Office Supplies." The attribute "Tipo de tinta: À base de água" (Ink type: Water-based) explicitly indicates that the ink is not solvent-based, thus not flammable or toxic in the way Hazmat chemicals are defined.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

23. **MLB42237577: Adesivo Cola De Contato Sapateiro Artesanato Colar Conserto Sapato Couro Tênis Cascola Bisnaga 30g**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a contact adhesive, commonly used for shoe repair and crafts. Contact adhesives typically contain highly flammable solvents (e.g., toluene, acetone, hexane) to allow for quick drying and strong bonding. The Hazmat definition explicitly includes "solvents" and "flammable liquids" (e.g., Acetone). While the product states "É tóxico: Não," this often refers to chronic toxicity or toxicity after drying, not necessarily the acute hazards like flammability or inhalation risk of the solvents during application. The nature of "contact adhesive" strongly suggests the presence of flammable solvents.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reasoning for Confidence:** Contact adhesives are well-known for their solvent content and flammability.

24. **MLB22648383: Caneta Fixa Com Corrente Para Balcão Mesa Tipo Bolinha Cor da tinta Azul Cor do exterior Cromada**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a desk pen. Pens are standard "Office Supplies." The ink in standard ballpoint pens is not considered hazardous.

    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a study guide/workbook. Books and paper products are classified under "Office Supplies" and are not hazardous.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

26. **MLB36761070: Maleta De Pintura Infantil 86 Peças Estojo Para Colorir**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a children's painting case. Similar to product 18, it is assumed to contain child-safe, non-hazardous art supplies (e.g., water-based paints/markers, crayons, pencils).
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

27. **MLB46105774: Reabastecedor Refil Marcador Permanente Compactor 30ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a refill ink for permanent markers. Permanent marker inks are typically solvent-based (e.g., alcohol, xylene, ketones) to ensure quick drying and permanence on various surfaces. These solvents are often flammable liquids. The Hazmat definition includes "solvents" and "flammable liquids" (e.g., Acetone, Paint thinner). This is a chemical product sold separately that likely contains flammable components.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reasoning for Confidence:** Permanent marker inks are generally known to be solvent-based and flammable.

28. **MLB45424317: Mochila Shoulder Bag Ombro Transversal Impermeável Pequena Cor Preto Desenho Do Tecido Liso**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a shoulder bag made of synthetic leather and Oxford fabric. It's a general consumer good, similar to other bags, and does not meet any Hazmat criteria.

Batch 52:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Product 1: MLB22772282 - Caderno Inteligente Grande Basic Black Preto**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is described as a "Caderno" (notebook) with paper and spiral binding. The Hazmat definition lists "Office supplies" as a non-Hazmat indicator. Notebooks are standard office/school supplies and do not contain any substances classified as radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 2: MLB24720437 - Giz Lousa Colorido Para Quadro Negro Caixa C/ 500 Unidades**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is "Giz Lousa" (chalk for blackboard). The attributes explicitly state "É tóxico": "Não" (Is toxic: No), "É um produto hipoalergênico": "Sim" (Is hypoallergenic: Yes), and "É livre de pó": "Sim" (Is dust-free: Yes). Chalk is a common school supply. The definition lists "Office supplies" as a non-Hazmat indicator. Given the explicit non-toxic and hypoallergenic attributes, it does not pose a risk as defined for Hazmat.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 3: MLB26891499 - Cola Titebond 3 Ultimate Glue 473ml Prova D Agua Madeira**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is "Cola" (glue) for wood. While some chemical products can be Hazmat, the attributes explicitly state "É tóxico": "Não" (Is toxic: No). This directly contradicts the classification criteria for toxic substances (Class 6). Glues that are explicitly non-toxic and water-based (implied by "Prova D Agua Madeira" and general knowledge of Titebond 3 as a water-based aliphatic resin emulsion) are not typically classified as Hazmat.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 4: MLB24226750 - Marcador P/ Porcelana Creative Marker Compactor Cor Ouro**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Marcador" (marker) for porcelain with "Tipo de tinta": "À base de água" (Water-based ink). Water-based inks are generally not considered flammable or toxic to the degree that would classify them as Hazmat. The definition lists "Office supplies" and "Personal care items (non-aerosol)" as non-Hazmat indicators, and this fits the general category of safe-for-consumer-use writing instruments.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 5: MLB24643535 - Base De Corte Tk 30x30 Silhouette Cameo Com Cola - Com 3 Un**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Base De Corte" (cutting mat) made of "POLÍMERO DE ALTA PERFORMANCE" (high-performance polymer). The "Com Cola" (With glue) refers to an adhesive surface for holding materials, not a separate container of hazardous glue. The material itself is not listed as hazardous, nor does it typically possess Hazmat characteristics. It falls under "Basic tools and hardware" (non-Hazmat).
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 6: MLB28824956 - Pincel Atomico Marcador Permanente 1100p Azul Cx 12 Un Pilot**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Marcador Permanente" (permanent marker) with "Tipo de tinta": "permanente" (permanent ink). Permanent markers commonly use solvent-based inks (e.g., alcohol, xylene, toluene) which can be flammable (Class 3: Flammable Liquids) or toxic (Class 6: Toxic Substances) due to the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) they contain. The Hazmat definition explicitly mentions "solvents" as a Hazmat indicator.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat
*   **Reason:** Permanent markers typically contain flammable or toxic solvents in their ink, which are classified as Flammable Liquids (Class 3) or Toxic Substances (Class 6). The definition lists "solvents" as a Hazmat indicator.
*   **Confidence:** Medium

**Product 7: MLB40442115 - Muzunga: Não Tem Subtítulo, De Elisabete Da Cruz. Tem Série, Vol. 1. Editorial Ciranda Na Escola, Capa Mole, Primeira Edição Em Português, 2024**

*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 8: MLB23349378 - Nisti Print Caderno de Caligrafia 160 folhas capa dura 1 assuntos unidade x 1 21cm x 14.8cm caderno caligrafia cor azul-claro**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Caderno de Caligrafia" (calligraphy notebook) with paper and a hard cover. Notebooks are standard office/school supplies. The Hazmat definition lists "Office supplies" as a non-Hazmat indicator.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Mochila E Estojo" (Backpack and Pencil Case set) made of "Poliéster" (polyester). These are general consumer goods, not containing any hazardous materials. The definition lists "Clothing & Textiles" and "Furniture & Home Goods" as non-Hazmat indicators, and this product fits within such general categories.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

**Product 10: MLB42877192 - Kit 2 Caderneta Sem Pauta Anotações Tipo Moleskine 80 F**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Caderneta" (notebook) with paper. Notebooks are standard office/school supplies. The Hazmat definition lists "Office supplies" as a non-Hazmat indicator.

*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Pincel Atômico Marcador Permanente" (permanent marker) with "Tipo de tinta": "permanente" (permanent ink). Similar to product MLB28824956, permanent markers commonly use solvent-based inks which can be flammable (Class 3: Flammable Liquids) or toxic (Class 6: Toxic Substances). The Hazmat definition explicitly mentions "solvents" as a Hazmat indicator.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat
*   **Reason:** Permanent markers typically contain flammable or toxic solvents in their ink, which are classified as Flammable Liquids (Class 3) or Toxic Substances (Class 6). The definition lists "solvents" as a Hazmat indicator.
*   **Confidence:** Medium

**Product 14: MLB29472445 - Caneta Hidrográfica Pilot Color 850 Jr Azul 12 Unidades**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Caneta Hidrográfica" (hydrographic pen/felt-tip pen) with "Tipo de tinta": "À base de água" (Water-based ink). Water-based inks are generally not flammable or toxic to the degree that would classify them as Hazmat. This is a common office/school supply.

*   **Reasoning:** This product is "Cola Super Bonder" (Super Bonder glue) and its attributes explicitly state "É tóxico": "Sim" (Is toxic: Yes). The Hazmat definition classifies "Toxic substances" (Class 6) as hazardous materials, including those liable to cause death or serious injury if inhaled, swallowed, or by skin absorption, or harmful to human health. An explicit "toxic" attribute makes this a clear Hazmat.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat
*   **Reason:** The product is explicitly stated as "toxic" ("É tóxico": "Sim"), which classifies it as a toxic substance (Class 6 Hazmat).
*   **Confidence:** High

**Product 16: MLB37097157 - Estojo Canetas Marcadores Ponta Dupla 24 Cores Kit Canetinha Fussen**
*   **Reasoning:** This product is "Canetas Marcadores" (marker pens) with "Tipo de tinta": "À base de álcool" (Alcohol-based ink). Alcohol is a flammable liquid. The Hazmat definition includes "Flammable Liquids" (Class 3) as hazardous materials, with examples like Acetone and Kerosene. Alcohol-based inks fall under this category.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat
*   **Reason:** The markers contain "alcohol-based ink," which is a flammable liquid (Class 3), thus classifying it as a Hazmat.
*   **Confidence:** High

**Product 17: MLB42250089 - 100 Folhas A4 Adesiva Offset Fosca Lisa Imp Cartucho E Laser Cor Branco**

Batch 53:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product based on the provided Hazmat definition, which categorizes hazardous materials into nine classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic and Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, and Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances). I will also refer to the examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods provided. Key indicators for Hazmat include chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners), aerosol sprays, pressurized containers, automotive chemicals, industrial chemicals, batteries (sold separately), and substances that are flammable, corrosive, or toxic. Non-Hazmat indicators include food, complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, and furniture/home goods.

Batch 54:
Here's a detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **MLB32545619 - Kit 10 Estojo Zip Zap Cor Transparente Liso**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is described as a "pencil case" made of "plastic". It is a basic school/office supply.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** It does not fall into any of the Hazmat classes (explosives, gases, flammable liquids/solids, oxidizing agents, toxic/infectious substances, radioactive substances, corrosive substances, or miscellaneous hazardous substances like asbestos or dry ice). It contains no chemicals, compressed gases, or other hazardous properties.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** It aligns with "Office Supplies" listed as a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB43014741 - Estojo Triplo Tigor T Tigre Varsity Pacific 977s15 Cor Azul**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is also a "pencil case" made of "polyester". It is a basic school/office supply.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Similar to the previous pencil case, it lacks any hazardous characteristics defined as Hazmat.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** It aligns with "Office Supplies" listed as a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB44015709 - Caneta Esferográfica Bic Cristal Azul - Caixa 50 Unidades Exterior Transparente**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a "ballpoint pen" with "oil-based ink". The definition explicitly lists "Blue ballpoint pen Bic crystal" under "Office Supplies" as a non-Hazmat example. While oil-based inks can contain minor solvents, in the context of a consumer ballpoint pen, they are not typically considered Hazmat for transport.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** Does not meet criteria for any Hazmat class.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** Explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat example under "Office Supplies".
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB27723214 - 10 Mil Etiquetas Termica 10x15cm Etiqueta Adesiva Ecomerce C Cor Branco**
    *   **Analysis:** This product consists of "thermal labels/stickers" made of "paper" and is "adhesive". Paper products are generally not hazardous.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** No indication of hazardous chemicals in the thermal paper or adhesive that would classify it as Hazmat.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** It aligns with "Office Supplies" listed as a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB28278197 - Marcador Atomico 1100-p Pilot Caixa C/12 Unid. Cor Vermelho**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a "permanent marker" with "permanent ink". Permanent marker inks commonly contain flammable solvents (e.g., alcohols, ketones). The Hazmat definition states that "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" are Hazmat indicators, and "Flammable liquids" are Class 3 Hazmat. Even in small quantities within a pen, the hazardous characteristic of the solvent (flammability) is present.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** The ink contains flammable solvents, classifying it under Class 3: Flammable Liquids.
    *   **Confidence:** Medium, as the quantity per unit is small, but the substance itself is hazardous.
    *   **Conclusion:** Hazmat.

6.  **MLB22621894 - Calculadora De Mesa Visor Grande 12 Dígitos Preto FBG 837-B**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a "desktop calculator" that is "Solar/Pilha" (solar/battery powered). It is a complete electronic device.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** The definition lists "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat, but "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are listed as non-Hazmat. This calculator falls under complete electronic devices, and the battery is integrated or comes with the device, not sold separately.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** Falls under "Complete electronic devices" and "Office Supplies".
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

7.  **MLB37836745 - Kit Cola B7000 + T7000 110ml Grande Celular Tablet Multiuso Cor Kit B-7000 E T-7000**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a "liquid glue" (cola) for multi-purpose use. The attributes state "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No). However, many liquid adhesives, especially those used for electronics or general-purpose bonding, contain solvents or other chemical components that can be flammable or cause irritation/sensitization. The definition includes "allergenic" as a hazardous characteristic and "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Without a specific chemical breakdown, it's safer to assume potential hazards common to liquid glues.
    *   **Hazmat Check:** As a liquid chemical product (adhesive), it likely contains components that are flammable or irritating/sensitizing (allergenic), aligning with the Hazmat definition for chemical products or potential Class 3 Flammable Liquids if solvent-based.
    *   **Confidence:** Medium, as "Is toxic: No" is stated, but flammability or other chemical hazards (like allergens/irritants) are not ruled out and are common for this type of product.
    *   **Conclusion:** Hazmat.

    *   **Hazmat Check:** Contact adhesives are generally solvent-based and highly flammable, classifying them under Class 3: Flammable Liquids.
    *   **Confidence:** High, due to the inherent nature and common composition of contact adhesives.

    *   **Hazmat Check:** Does not meet criteria for any Hazmat class.
    *   **Non-Hazmat Indicator:** Falls under "Office Supplies" and "Natural materials".
    *   **Conclusion:** Non-Hazmat.

Here's my detailed reasoning process for classifying each product:

1.  **MLB21587295 - Roteiro Para Construir No Nordeste, 3.ed, Armando De Holanda**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is identified as a "book" ("Título do livro", "Autor", "Editora do livro", "Gênero do livro"). Books are explicitly listed as "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" under "Office Supplies" or generally as complete devices/items without hazardous components. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous materials (e.g., flammable, toxic, corrosive).
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB25845222 - Caneta Permanente Retro Projetor Pilot Cd Dvd Plástico Acrílico Vinil Vidro Cor Preto**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a "Caneta Permanente" (Permanent Pen/Marker). The key attribute is "Tipo de tinta": "À base de álcool" (Alcohol-based ink). The Hazmat definition lists "Flammable Liquids" and provides examples like "Gasoline (petrol), Acetone". Alcohol is a flammable liquid. Although the quantity in a single pen is small, the substance itself is hazardous due to its flammability. The "HAZMAT Indicators" also include "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)". Alcohol acts as a solvent in the ink.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** Contains alcohol-based ink, which is a flammable liquid/solvent.
    *   **Confidence:** High.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB29622601 - Caneta Dual Brush Marcador Artistico Tons De Cinza Cis C/6**

Batch 60:
## Hazmat Classification Analysis

Here's a detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **MLB30481414 - Pincel Atômico Canetão Grosso 4 Cores Pilot P/ Cartaz Avisos**
    *   **Analysis:** The product description states the `Tipo de tinta` (Type of ink) is `'À base de álcool'` (Alcohol-based). The Hazmat definition lists "Flammable Liquids" (Class 3) and includes "solvents" as a HAZMAT indicator. Alcohol is a flammable liquid and acts as a solvent. Therefore, an alcohol-based ink product is likely flammable and falls under Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat

2.  **MLB19203740 - Análise técnica do mercado financeiro: Um guia abrangente de aplicações e métodos de negociação - Editora Alta Books**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is a book. The Hazmat definition explicitly lists "Books" as a non-Hazmat category implicitly by including other office supplies and complete electronic devices as non-Hazmat, and not including books in any Hazmat class.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

3.  **MLB44375137 - Estojo Maleta Pintura Escolar Infantil 68 Peças Cor Azul-celeste Carros**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a children's painting kit. There is no information suggesting the paints or materials within are hazardous (e.g., lead-based, highly flammable solvents). General art supplies for children are typically non-Hazmat unless specific hazardous components are listed.

4.  **MLB24010950 - Papel Dupla Face A4 220g Matte Masterprint/xfull 100 F Cor Branco**

    *   **Analysis:** This product consists of rubber bands made of latex. While latex can be an allergen for some individuals, the Hazmat definition's mention of "allergenic" is broad and does not provide specific examples that would include common office supplies like rubber bands. The primary focus of the Hazmat definition is on chemical/physical risks like flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, etc., that pose a risk even when not being transported. Common rubber bands do not fall into these categories.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

19. **MLB27659812 - Grampeador Papel Pequeno Escritório Escolar Profissional**

22. **MLB29678850 - 3M Fita Dupla Face 12mm x 5m verde escuro**
    *   **Analysis:** This product is double-sided adhesive tape made of polypropylene. While some industrial adhesives can be Hazmat due to flammable solvents, common household/office adhesive tapes are generally not classified as hazardous materials.

Batch 61:
Here's my detailed reasoning process for classifying each product:

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I will refer to the provided Hazmat definition, which categorizes materials based on risks (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, allergenic, compressed gases/liquids, hot materials). I will also leverage the explicit "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" provided, such as "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)", "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers", "Batteries (when sold separately)", and "Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances" for HAZMAT, versus "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)", "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)", "Basic tools and hardware", and "Office supplies" for NON-HAZMAT.

Batch 62:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Description and Attributes:** For each product, I examine its title and attributes to understand its composition, purpose, and any specific characteristics mentioned (e.g., "flammable," "ink type").
2.  **Compare with Hazmat Definition and Examples:** I cross-reference the product's characteristics with the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the nine classes of dangerous goods and the specific examples given for Hazmat and Non-Hazmat items.
3.  **Identify Key Hazmat Indicators:** I look for indicators such as chemical products, aerosol sprays, batteries (sold separately), and substances explicitly stated as flammable, corrosive, toxic, etc.
4.  **Identify Key Non-Hazmat Indicators:** I also check if the product falls under categories explicitly listed as Non-Hazmat, such as complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, and non-aerosol personal care items.
5.  **Determine Classification and Confidence:** Based on the comparison, I classify the product as Hazmat or Non-Hazmat. If classified as Hazmat, I provide a specific reason and confidence level. If non-Hazmat, no reason or confidence is required by the schema.

Batch 63:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Title and Attributes:** Extract key information from the product title and its associated attributes, focusing on material, type, and any specific characteristics mentioned (e.g., "ink," "paint," "natural," "toxic," "flammable").
2.  **Compare with Hazmat Definition and Examples:**
    *   Check if the product or its components are explicitly listed as Hazmat examples (e.g., "paint," "thinner," "aerosol," "battery sold separately," "acids," "flammable liquids").
    *   Determine if the product possesses any of the hazardous characteristics: radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, or if it's a compressed gas/liquid or hot material.
    *   Look for "HAZMAT Indicators" provided in the definition, such as "Chemical products," "Aerosol sprays," "Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances."
3.  **Compare with Non-Hazmat Examples and Indicators:**
    *   Check if the product is explicitly listed as a Non-Hazmat example (e.g., "Food and beverages," "Complete electronic devices," "Natural materials," "Basic tools and hardware," "Office supplies," "Personal care items (non-aerosol)," "Furniture and home goods").
    *   If the product is a common item made of non-hazardous materials (like paper, fabric, plastic, metal without hazardous contents), it's likely non-Hazmat.
4.  **Determine Confidence and Reason (if Hazmat):**
    *   If classified as Hazmat, provide a concise reason based on the hazardous characteristic or class.
    *   Assign a confidence level (low, medium, high) based on the clarity of the information and how directly it aligns with the Hazmat definition. Low confidence is used when there's a possibility but not absolute certainty (e.g., "painting kit" which *could* contain flammable paints, but isn't explicitly stated).

---

**Product Analysis:**

*   **MLB29553693 - 10 Unidades Caderneta Em Kraft**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a notebook made of Kraft paper. The Hazmat definition explicitly lists "Office supplies" like "A4 sulfite paper" as non-Hazmat. Paper is a natural material and does not possess any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB27090033 - Tinta Para Carimbo Auto-entintado 40ml - Preto - Radex**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "Tinta" (ink) for a stamp. The Hazmat definition includes "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and lists "Tinta esmalte sintético" (synthetic enamel paint) as a Class 3 Flammable Liquid. While the specific type of ink (e.g., water-based vs. solvent-based) is not specified, inks can contain flammable solvents. Given the general classification of "chemical products" and "paints" as Hazmat, it's prudent to classify ink as potentially hazardous unless explicitly stated otherwise (e.g., "water-based").
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Chemical product, potential for flammable components (similar to paints/solvents).
    *   **Confidence:** Medium

*   **MLB31065135 - Cartelas De Bingo Coloridas 05 Blocos 500 Cartelas 8x10cm**
    *   **Reasoning:** These are bingo cards, which are made of paper. Paper is a common office/school supply and a non-hazardous material.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB45091432 - Estojo escolar Sestini Creeper cor verde lisa**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a school pencil case made of polyester. This is a common school supply and does not contain any hazardous materials or characteristics. It falls under general "Office supplies" or "Clothing & Textiles" (similar material) which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB40673642 - Maleta De Pintura 150 Peças 3 Palavrinhas**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a "Maleta De Pintura" (Painting Kit). While it lists "lápis" (pencils) and "borracha" (erasers), a painting kit typically includes various types of paints, markers, or other art supplies. Some paints (especially solvent-based ones) can be flammable liquids (Class 3) or contain other hazardous chemicals. Without specific information about the types of paints included, the potential for hazardous components exists, similar to "Tinta esmalte sintético" which is a Hazmat example.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Painting kits often contain paints or markers that could be flammable or contain solvents, similar to Class 3 Flammable Liquids, or other chemical products.
    *   **Confidence:** Low

*   **MLB43985848 - 3kg Argila Natural Modelar Artesanato Escultura Escolar Vaso Cor Bege**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "Argila Natural" (Natural Clay). The Hazmat definition lists "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)" as non-Hazmat. Natural clay, in its modeling form, is not radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, toxic, or otherwise hazardous according to the definition.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB27892379 - 3M Embalagem kit 4 fita adesiva transparente 45mm x 45m**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is transparent adhesive tape. Adhesive tapes are common office or packaging supplies. While some industrial adhesives can be hazardous, standard packaging tape is generally not classified as Hazmat. It falls under "Office supplies" or "Basic tools and hardware" which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB28850289 - Almofada Carimbo Grande N4 + Tinta Refil Preta Inclusa**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product includes a stamp pad and a black ink refill. Crucially, the attributes state "Tipos de tinta recomendada: Tinta á base de água" (Recommended ink types: Water-based ink). Water-based inks are generally considered non-hazardous, as they lack the flammable solvents found in some other types of ink or paint.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB23327288 - Mochila Hang Loose Plain Masculina P/ Notebook Moderna Reforçada 30 Litros Cor Preto Desenho do tecido Modelo 1**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a backpack made of polyester. Backpacks are personal items/accessories and are not considered hazardous materials. They fall under general merchandise, similar to "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB22674322 - Caneta Pentel Energel Retrátil - 0.5mm - Marrom**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a gel pen. Pens are common "Office supplies" which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat (e.g., "Blue ballpoint pen Bic crystal"). The small amount of ink in a pen, especially gel ink, is not typically hazardous.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB45059656 - Mochila Penalty Escolar 20l Reforçada Com 4 Compartimentos**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a backpack made of polyester. Same reasoning as MLB23327288.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB23048352 - Carimbo Datador Automatico Colop S-120**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is an automatic date stamp. While it contains ink, it's an integrated office device. The ink is typically a small, self-contained, water-based or low-hazard formulation, similar to the water-based ink in the stamp pad. It falls under "Office supplies" which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB50861405 - Caderno De Colorir E Pintar Capa Dura Edição Coleção Cor Azul**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a coloring book. Books and notebooks are made of paper and are classified as "Office supplies" or general merchandise, which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB22721895 - Mochila Lona Reforçada KVN KV9701 Cor Preto Desenho do tecido Liso**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a backpack made of canvas ("lona"). Same reasoning as MLB23327288.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

*   **MLB26241587 - Giz Lousa Cilíndrico Plastificado Branco 50 Unidades**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is blackboard chalk. The attributes explicitly state "É tóxico: Não" (Is toxic: No) and "É livre de pó: Sim" (Is dust-free: Yes). This directly addresses potential health hazards, indicating it is not toxic. Chalk is a common school supply.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

Batch 64:
Here's my detailed reasoning process for classifying each product:

1.  **Product 1: MLB48945597**
    *   **Title:** 'Conjunto De Canetas Marcador Permanente Ponta Dupla 24 Cores - Marca Horiz' (Set of Dual Tip Permanent Marker Pens 24 Colors - Horiz Brand)
    *   **Attributes:** `'Tipo de tinta': 'À base de álcool'` (Ink type: Alcohol-based)
    *   **Reasoning:** The attributes explicitly state that the ink is "alcohol-based". Alcohol is a flammable liquid. The Hazmat definition includes "Flammable Liquids" (Class 3) and mentions "Gasoline (petrol), Acetone" as examples. Alcohol falls under this category of flammable substances. The "HAZMAT Indicators" also list "Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances". Therefore, this product is a Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat

2.  **Product 2: MLB32810851**
    *   **Title:** 'Maleta Escolar Infantil Pintura 150 Peças Desenhar Colorir' (Children's School Painting Case 150 Pieces Drawing Coloring)
    *   **Attributes:** `Inclui lápis': 'Sim', 'Inclui borracha plástica': 'Sim'` (Includes pencils: Yes, Includes plastic eraser: Yes)

Batch 65:
Here's a detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**General Principle Applied:**
The Hazmat definition clearly distinguishes between hazardous materials (substances posing risks) and non-hazardous goods. A key indicator for non-Hazmat items is "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" even though they contain components like batteries, which *if sold separately* could be Hazmat. Similarly, common office supplies are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat.

---

*   **Analysis:** This product is a school pencil case made of polyester. It's a common article for organizing school supplies.

Batch 66:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product:

The core principle for classifying these products is based on the "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" which explicitly state "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are not Hazmat. Conversely, the "HAZMAT Indicators" specify "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat. In the case of all the listed products, they are complete smartphones or cell phones with integrated batteries, meaning the batteries are not being sold separately. Therefore, none of these products are classified as Hazmat according to the provided definition.

Here's the classification for each product:

*   **MLB41987247: Samsung Galaxy S24 Fe 256gb 8gb 5g cinza**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a complete smartphone. The Hazmat definition explicitly lists "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" as non-Hazmat.

    *   Honor X8b Dual SIM 256 GB verde 8 GB RAM (MLB37096253)

    Although these devices contain lithium-ion (or polymer) batteries, the definition specifies that "Batteries (when sold separately)" are Hazmat, implying that when integrated into a complete electronic device, the device itself is not classified as Hazmat.

2.  **Carregador portátil Samsung Power Bank (MLB25933435):**
    This product is explicitly described as a "Carregador portátil" (portable charger) and "Power Bank", with "Tipo de bateria: Li-ion" and "Capacidade da bateria: 10 Ah". The Hazmat definition clearly lists "Batteries (when sold separately)" as a **HAZMAT Indicator**. A power bank is essentially a battery sold as a standalone product, separate from the electronic device it charges. Therefore, it falls under the Hazmat classification.

All the products listed are complete electronic devices, specifically smartphones or headphones. According to the provided Hazmat definition, "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are explicitly categorized under "NON-HAZMAT Indicators". While these devices contain lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries, the definition specifies that "Batteries (when sold separately)" are Hazmat, implying that batteries integrated within a complete device are not classified as Hazmat for transport purposes. Therefore, none of these products are Hazmat.

Batch 71:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**General Reasoning for all products:**
All the listed products are smartphones or cell phones. The Hazmat definition explicitly states that "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are **NON-HAZMAT**. While these devices contain batteries (often Lithium-ion or Lithium Polymer, as seen in some attributes), the definition specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat. This implies that when integrated into a complete, functional electronic device, the device itself is not classified as a Hazmat for transport purposes under this definition. Therefore, all these products are classified as Non-Hazmat.

---

Batch 72:
**Reasoning Process:**

The core of this classification relies on the provided Hazmat definition, particularly the "Key Classification Principles". A crucial point highlighted is:
*   **NON-HAZMAT Indicators:** "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)"
*   **HAZMAT Indicators:** "Batteries (when sold separately)"

I will analyze each product to determine if it is a "complete electronic device" or a "battery sold separately". All products listed are smartphones or feature phones. While these devices contain integrated lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries, the definition clearly states that *complete electronic devices* are non-Hazmat, distinguishing them from *batteries sold separately*. Therefore, the presence of an integrated battery does not classify these products as Hazmat.

Based on this principle, all listed products, being complete electronic devices (smartphones/feature phones), are classified as Non-Hazmat.

Batch 73:
**Reasoning Process:**

The provided Hazmat definition clearly distinguishes between "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" and "Batteries (when sold separately)". The definition states that complete electronic devices are **NON-HAZMAT**, while batteries sold separately are **HAZMAT**.

All products in the list are various models of "smartphones" or "celular" (mobile phones), which fall under the category of "Complete electronic devices". Although these devices contain integrated batteries (typically Lithium-ion or Lithium-polymer, as seen in the attributes like "Tipo de bateria: Polímero de lítio" or "Íon de lítio"), they are not being sold as standalone batteries. Therefore, according to the provided definition, they are classified as Non-Hazmat.

Batch 1:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

The core of this classification relies on the provided "Hazmat definition" and its "Examples of Hazmat and Reasons for Classification" versus "Examples of goods classified as non-Hazmat".

A critical non-Hazmat indicator is:
*   **Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)**

All the products in the list are various models of "Celular" (cell phone) or "Smartphone". These clearly fall under the category of "Complete electronic devices".

While these devices contain lithium-ion or lithium polymer batteries, the Hazmat definition explicitly states that "Batteries (when sold separately)" are Hazmat. When integrated into a complete electronic device like a phone, the device itself is generally not classified as Hazmat for transport purposes under typical regulations, as long as the battery is properly installed and the device is not damaged or defective. The provided definition supports this by listing "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" as non-Hazmat.

Therefore, all listed products, being complete mobile phone devices, are classified as non-Hazmat.

Batch 3:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product based on the provided Hazmat definition, paying close attention to the "Examples of Hazmat and Reasons for Classification" and "Key Classification Principles". The most crucial indicator for these products is whether they are "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" (Non-Hazmat) or "Batteries (when sold separately)" (Hazmat).

Batch 7:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I have carefully reviewed each product's title and attributes against the provided Hazmat definition, including its nine classes, examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods, and key classification principles.

My process involved:
1.  **Identifying the core nature of the product:** Is it a chemical, an electronic device, a food item, a tool, or a general household item?
2.  **Checking for Hazmat indicators:** I looked for keywords like "chemical," "paint," "solvent," "ink," "toner," "battery (sold separately)," "flammable," "corrosive," "toxic," or any explicit mention of hazardous characteristics. I also cross-referenced with the examples provided in the definition.
3.  **Checking for Non-Hazmat indicators:** I verified if the product falls under categories explicitly listed as non-Hazmat, such as "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)," "Food and beverages," "Natural materials," "Basic tools and hardware," "Office supplies," "Personal care items (non-aerosol)," and "Furniture and home goods."
4.  **Assessing specific components/attributes:** For products like electronic devices, I specifically checked if hazardous components (e.g., batteries) were sold separately or integrated. For chemical-containing products, I considered the nature and quantity of the substance.
5.  **Determining Confidence:** For Hazmat classifications, I assigned a confidence level based on how explicitly the product or its components fit the provided Hazmat criteria. If a chemical product was implied but not fully detailed (e.g., "thermal paste"), I opted for medium confidence, while clear chemical products (e.g., "ink," "toner") received high confidence.

**Individual Product Analysis:**

Batch 8:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product classification:

1.  **MLB21364840: Headset Office Para Computador Telefone Pc Notebook com Conector Usb Com Microfone 5+**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a wired electronic accessory for computers. It does not contain any substances explicitly listed as hazardous in the definition (e.g., flammables, corrosives, gases, radioactive materials, or standalone batteries). It falls under the "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" non-Hazmat indicator as an accessory.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

2.  **MLB11555282: Mesa Escrivaninha para Escritório Branco L127cm ME4135 Tecnomobili**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an office desk made of MDP. It is a piece of furniture and does not contain any hazardous materials. It aligns with the "Furniture and home goods" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

3.  **MLB26986124: Placa de Rede PCI-e Adaptador Wi-Fi 6 e Bluetooth TP-Link Archer TX20e Ax1800 com 2 Antenas**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an electronic component (network card) for a computer. It does not contain any standalone batteries or other hazardous materials. It falls under the general category of "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" (as a component) which are indicated as non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

4.  **MLB51657126: Mouse Gamer Force One Sirius 10.000 Dpi - Rgb Wireless Usb-c**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a wireless, rechargeable mouse, explicitly stating "Tipo de alimentação sem fio: Bateria" and "É recarregável: Sim". The Hazmat definition includes "Batteries (when sold separately)" and provides "18650 lithium battery" as a Class 9 example. While the battery is integrated, rechargeable batteries, especially lithium-ion (common in wireless, rechargeable electronics), pose a fire risk during transport. Therefore, the product containing such a battery is classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Contains a rechargeable battery (likely lithium-ion) which poses a fire risk during transport, similar to the "18650 lithium battery" example under Class 9.
    *   **Confidence:** High

5.  **MLB40558803: Warzone Night Battle Pré-treino 360g Passion Fury Under Labz Sabor PASSION FURY - ALTA PERFORMANCE**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a nutritional supplement in powder form. The Hazmat definition's "Toxic and Infectious Substances" class refers to materials like potassium cyanide or pesticides, which are far more hazardous. Nutritional supplements are generally considered "Food and beverages" for classification purposes, which is a non-Hazmat indicator.

17. **MLB29541463: Caneta Logitech R400 Apresentador Multimídia Lazer Sem Fio Negro**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an electronic peripheral that uses "Pilha" (battery) for power. However, the definition specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat, and "Complete electronic devices" as non-Hazmat. For small electronic devices, standard dry-cell batteries (like AAA implied here) when installed are generally not considered Hazmat. The specific Hazmat battery example is "18650 lithium battery", which implies a higher risk category.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

18. **MLB19842584: Kit Teclado E Mouse Sem Fio Preto Maketech Cw-0280 10 Mt Top**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a kit of wireless electronic peripherals. The attributes state "Inclui bateria: Não" and "É recarregável: Não", implying it operates with standard disposable batteries which are not included.

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

23. **MLB27050183: Pasta Térmica Bisnaga 50 Gramas | Implastec Alta Temperatura**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "Pasta Térmica" (thermal paste), which is a chemical product. Although the attribute states "É inflamável: Não", the Hazmat definition includes "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators.

Batch 11:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I will strictly adhere to the provided definition, which outlines characteristics (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, allergenic, compressed gases/liquids, hot materials) and provides specific examples across nine classes.
2.  **Identify Key Indicators:** I will look for keywords in product titles and attributes that align with Hazmat characteristics or examples (e.g., "battery," "toner," "ink," "chemical," "spray," "gas," "acid," "flammable," "corrosive," "toxic").
3.  **Cross-Reference with Examples:** I will compare the product against both the "Examples of goods classified as Hazmat" and "Examples of goods classified as non-Hazmat" provided in the definition.
4.  **Evaluate "Complete Electronic Devices" vs. "Batteries (when sold separately)":** The definition explicitly states "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are NON-HAZMAT, but "Batteries (when sold separately)" are HAZMAT. This distinction is crucial for products containing integrated batteries (e.g., laptops, wireless mice) versus standalone batteries or devices where the battery *is* the primary hazardous component (e.g., UPS systems with large internal lead-acid batteries).
5.  **Assess Chemical Products:** For products identified as chemical (e.g., thermal paste, inks), I will consider their potential for toxicity, flammability, or irritancy, even if not explicitly listed in the examples, as the general definition of "substance that poses a risk" and "chemical products" indicator applies.

Batch 13:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand Hazmat Definition:** I carefully reviewed the definition, the nine classes of hazardous materials, and the specific examples provided for both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods. Key indicators for Hazmat include chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners), aerosol sprays, pressurized containers, automotive chemicals, industrial chemicals, batteries (when sold separately), and flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances. Key indicators for Non-Hazmat include complete electronic devices (phones, computers), food and beverages, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, and furniture.

2.  **Product Analysis:** I analyzed each product's title and attributes to identify its nature and determine if it possesses any hazardous characteristics or falls under any of the Hazmat classes or indicators.

    *   **Products classified as Hazmat:**
        *   **MLB37746936 (Toner Compatível):** Toner powder is a chemical product and can be considered a combustible dust (Class 4: Flammable Solids) or an irritant (Class 6: Toxic Substances) due to fine particle size. This aligns with "Chemical products" and "Industrial chemicals and reagents" indicators.
        *   **MLB28484425 (Carregador De Pilhas Multilaser... Inclui pilhas):** The product explicitly states "Inclui pilhas: Sim" (Includes batteries). The definition specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as a Hazmat indicator. Since the batteries are included as distinct items with the charger, they fall under this hazardous category (Class 9: Miscellaneous, or potentially Class 8: Corrosive if lead-acid, though Ni-Cd/Ni-Mh are also hazardous).
        *   **MLB27512722 (Caixa De Eletrônicos Outros Caixa Surpresa Top):** This is a "mystery box of electronics." Due to the unknown contents, it's impossible to confirm that it *only* contains non-Hazmat "complete electronic devices." It could potentially contain "Batteries (when sold separately)" or other specific hazardous electronic components not integrated into a final device, making its classification uncertain. Following the guideline "If not certain of the classification, output as hazmat with lower confidence," this is classified as Hazmat.
        *   **MLB26094723 (Kit De Teclado E Mouse S/fio Wireless Branco... Inclui bateria):** Similar to the battery charger, this kit states "Inclui bateria: Sim" (Includes battery). This implies separate batteries (e.g., AA/AAA) are included for the wireless devices, which are classified as Hazmat when sold separately or included as distinct items in a kit.
        *   **MLB29399965 (Fotocondutor Compativel Para Oki):** A photoconductor is a component in laser printers that contains light-sensitive materials, which are chemical substances. These can include trace elements or coatings that may be hazardous. This falls under the "Chemical products" or "Industrial chemicals and reagents" indicators.
        *   **MLB36752469 (Cartucho de tinta Epson):** Printer ink is a chemical product, often containing solvents, pigments, and other compounds that can be flammable or toxic depending on their specific composition. This aligns with "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" indicator.
        *   **MLB29472254 (Fotocondutor Compatível Com Brother):** Similar to MLB29399965, this is a photoconductor unit containing chemical substances.
        *   **MLB46471660 (Toner Compativel Para Ricoh):** Similar to MLB37746936, this is a toner cartridge, a chemical product with potential for combustible dust.

    *   **Products classified as Non-Hazmat:** All other products are electronic devices, peripherals, cables, books, furniture, or food supplements. These categories are explicitly listed as Non-Hazmat or clearly fall outside the scope of hazardous materials described in the definition (e.g., complete electronic devices, office supplies, food, basic tools). For electronic devices containing integrated batteries (like the wireless microphone or mini keyboard), they are considered "Complete electronic devices" which are explicitly Non-Hazmat in the examples, differentiating them from batteries sold separately.

Batch 17:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Product 1: MLB19774216 - Limpeza Pesada Azulim Flotador Maximoon Limpa Tudo Spray**
*   **Reasoning:** The product is described as "Limpeza Pesada" (Heavy Duty Cleaning) and a "limpador multiuso" (multipurpose cleaner). The Hazmat definition lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Even though it states 'É inflamável': 'Não', heavy-duty cleaners often contain chemical components that can be corrosive, irritant, or harmful if mishandled.

*   **Reasoning:** This is a "Desinfetante Multiuso" (multipurpose disinfectant) and "Bactericida" (bactericidal). The Hazmat definition includes "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Disinfectants contain active chemical agents designed to kill microorganisms, which can be toxic or corrosive to humans if misused or ingested.

Batch 21:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product, followed by the JSON output.

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **MLB43428254 - Pano Mágico Limpa Vidros E Espelhos Ecomais Akora C/ 3 Un. Cor Verde-musgo**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a cleaning cloth made of microfibra. It is a non-chemical item used for cleaning surfaces.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The product description does not indicate any hazardous characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or the presence of compressed gases. It falls under the category of "Basic tools and hardware" or "Furniture and home goods" as per the non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

2.  **MLB26427158 - Rolo Pedra Jade + Placa Gua Sha Coração Massagem Facial Cor Outro**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a facial massage tool made of stone.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: There are no chemicals, gases, or other hazardous materials indicated. It is a personal care tool, not containing any hazardous substances.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

3.  **MLB26118833 - Kit Principia Anti-acne Gel De Limpeza + Sérum Mix-01**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a personal care kit (gel cleanser + serum) for anti-acne treatment. It's a chemical product applied to the skin.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The definition lists "Benzoyl peroxides" as a Class 5 Organic Peroxide and an example of Hazmat in the context of "acne treatment". While this product is for "Anti-acne", it does not explicitly state it contains benzoyl peroxide or any other specific hazardous chemical at concentrations that would classify it as Hazmat for transport. The non-Hazmat examples include "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)". This product is a common consumer cosmetic, typically formulated to be safe for general use and transport. Without explicit information on hazardous ingredients at dangerous concentrations, the general classification for personal care items applies.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

4.  **MLB16949154 - Detergente Em Pó Máquina Lavar Louças Limpol 1 Kg**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a powdered detergent for dishwashers. It is a chemical cleaner.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: While detergents are chemical products, common household detergents are generally not classified as Hazmat unless they exhibit strong corrosive, flammable, or toxic properties. The Hazmat examples for cleaners (muriatic acid, caustic soda, drain cleaner) are highly corrosive. This product is a standard dishwasher detergent, not indicated to be severely hazardous.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

5.  **MLB42467090 - Ar-condicionado Split Samsung Inverter Windfree Connect Ai 12.000 Btus Quente E Frio Sem Vento Ar12dxfaawknaz**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is an air conditioner. Its attributes specify "Tipo de gás refrigerante: R-32".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The Hazmat definition lists "Gases" (Class 2) as hazardous, including "Flammable gases" like "Propane". R-32 (difluoromethane) is a known mildly flammable refrigerant gas (A2L safety class). Even when contained within a complete device, the presence of a flammable gas can classify the item as Hazmat for transport. The definition explicitly includes "compressed gases/liquids" as Hazmat.
    *   **Conclusion**: Hazmat. Reason: Contains R-32, which is a flammable gas (Class 2). Confidence: High.

6.  **MLB42333798 - Sacos De Lixo 10l Perfumado Banheiro Cozinha Anti Odores**
    *   **Analysis**: This product consists of perfumed plastic trash bags.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: There are no hazardous characteristics mentioned. Plastic is a common material, and the "perfumed" aspect refers to a scent, not a hazardous chemical.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

7.  **MLB42081854 - Esfregão Elétrico Recarregável Giratório Multiuso 9 Em 1**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a rechargeable electric mop.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The product is a "complete electronic device" that contains an integrated rechargeable battery. The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)". The Hazmat indicator "Batteries (when sold separately)" specifically applies when batteries are shipped as standalone items, not when integrated into a functional device.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

8.  **MLB22378500 - Veja limpador perfumado lírio do nilo 2L**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a perfumed all-purpose cleaner. It is a chemical cleaner.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: Similar to other household cleaners, this product is not indicated to be highly corrosive, flammable, or toxic to a degree that would classify it as Hazmat. It's a common household cleaning product.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

9.  **MLB15982833 - Boehringer NexGard Cachorro 3 10 kg 25 kg**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a flea and tick treatment for dogs in tablet form.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The Hazmat definition lists "Pesticides" as Class 6 Toxic substances. Flea and tick treatments are designed to kill parasites and contain active ingredients that are toxic, thus falling under the "Pesticides" category.
    *   **Conclusion**: Hazmat. Reason: Contains active ingredients classified as pesticides (Class 6). Confidence: High.

10. **MLB28605660 - Limpador Perfumes Jasmim Do Caribe 500ml Veja**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a perfumed disinfectant cleaner. It is a chemical cleaner.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: Although it is a disinfectant (meaning it contains biocidal agents), common household disinfectants are generally not classified as Hazmat unless they are highly concentrated, corrosive, or severely toxic. There is no indication of such extreme properties.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

11. **MLB34102526 - Lavadora De Alta Pressão Philco Plp2600 1800psi 1600w**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a high-pressure washer.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: This is a complete tool. The attributes explicitly state "Inclui bateria: Não" and there are no indications of hazardous chemicals or gases. It falls under "Tools & Hardware (Non-Chemical)" in the non-Hazmat examples.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

12. **MLB41351264 - Kit de Escovas Higienizadoras Tender Trove - Limpeza Completa para Louças, Garrafas, Copos, Taças, Mamadeiras, Canudos e Bicos**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a kit of cleaning brushes made of plastic and silicone.

    *   **Hazmat Check**: No hazardous properties are indicated. It is a "Furniture & Home Goods" item.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

14. **MLB16262819 - Lavadora de alta pressão Philco PLA3100 azul de 1800W com 2100psi de pressão máxima**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a high-pressure washer.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: This is a complete tool. The attributes explicitly state "Inclui bateria: Não" and there are no indications of hazardous chemicals or gases. It falls under "Tools & Hardware (Non-Chemical)".
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

15. **MLB25712370 - Desengraxante H7 Limpeza Pesada Multiuso Removedor 5 Litros**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a heavy-duty multi-purpose degreaser. It is a chemical cleaner/remover.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: "Desengraxante" (degreaser) and "Limpeza Pesada" (heavy cleaning) suggest a strong chemical composition. While it states "É inflamável: Não", such products can contain strong alkaline or solvent components that may be corrosive (Class 8) or irritating, falling under "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" and "Products requiring safety warnings". Given its intended use for "heavy cleaning" and as a "remover," it implies stronger chemical action than a mild cleaner.
    *   **Conclusion**: Hazmat. Reason: It is a strong chemical cleaner, potentially corrosive or irritating (Class 8). Confidence: Medium.

16. **MLB19532361 - Balde mop com sistema de torção e enxágue cinza Celeste Rapid Clean**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a mop bucket with a mop.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: No hazardous properties are indicated. It is a "Furniture & Home Goods" or "Basic tools and hardware" item.

17. **MLB41806353 - Escova De Limpeza Esfregãomop Elétrico 9 Em 1 Multiuso**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is an electric cleaning brush/mop.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: This is a "complete electronic device" that contains an integrated battery (implied by "electric"). The non-Hazmat indicators explicitly list "Complete electronic devices". The Hazmat indicator "Batteries (when sold separately)" does not apply here.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

18. **MLB36263044 - Coletor Split Até 36 Mil Btus Para Limpeza Ar Condicionado Cor Azul**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a collector for cleaning air conditioners. It's a non-chemical accessory.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: No hazardous properties are indicated. It is a basic tool/accessory.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

19. **MLB19907851 - Pano Multiuso Limpeza Lavável Reutilizável 28x40cm 600un 240 Cor Azul**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a multipurpose cleaning cloth made of viscose/polyester.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: No hazardous properties are indicated. It is a basic cleaning tool made of textile material.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

20. **MLB16608302 - Refil Para Difusor Elétrico Bom Ar Fragrância Lavanda e Gerânio 16ml**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a liquid fragrance refill for an electric diffuser. It states "Com etanol: Não".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: Fragrance liquids are chemical products. While it states "Com etanol: Não" (no ethanol), other components could potentially be flammable or irritating. However, for a small volume (16ml) common household air freshener refill, it is generally not classified as Hazmat unless specific hazardous properties (e.g., low flash point, high toxicity) are indicated, which they are not here.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

21. **MLB19089153 - Limpador Quimatic Tapmatic Tira Grude cítrica em blíster**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a "sticky residue remover" (Tira Grude) in liquid form, 40ml. It states "É inflamável: Não".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: This is a chemical product (solvent/cleaner). However, it explicitly states "É inflamável: Não". Despite being a "remover" that implies strong action, the non-flammable attribute for a small consumer quantity makes it unlikely to be classified as Hazmat without further indication of severe corrosivity or toxicity.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

22. **MLB40345844 - Uau Limpador Perfumado Concentrado Eucalipto 130ml**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a concentrated perfumed cleaner. It is a chemical cleaner.

    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

23. **MLB19548227 - Mop Lava E Seca Fit 5 Litros Mop6088 Flash Limp Cor VERDE ESMERALDA**

    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

27. **MLB27118907 - Bravecto Antipulgas E Carrapatos Cães De 40 A 56kg**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is a flea and tick treatment for dogs in chewable tablet form.
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The Hazmat definition lists "Pesticides" as Class 6 Toxic substances. Flea and tick treatments are designed to kill parasites and contain active ingredients that are toxic, thus falling under the "Pesticides" category.

29. **MLB27145747 - Ar Condicionado LG Dual Inverter Voice 9.000 Btus Frio R-32**
    *   **Analysis**: This product is an air conditioner. Its attributes specify "Tipo de gás refrigerante: R-32".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The Hazmat definition lists "Gases" (Class 2) as hazardous, including "Flammable gases". R-32 (difluoromethane) is a known mildly flammable refrigerant gas. Even when contained within a complete device, the presence of a flammable gas can classify the item as Hazmat for transport. The definition explicitly includes "compressed gases/liquids" as Hazmat.
    *   **Conclusion**: Hazmat. Reason: Contains R-32, which is a flammable gas (Class 2). Confidence: High.

30. **MLB29262193 - Kit Lava Pet Escova Banho Cachorro Gato Dispenser + Luva Cor Diversas**

    *   **Analysis**: This product is a kitchen degreaser cleaner in spray form. It states "É inflamável: Não".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: While it is a chemical cleaner and comes in a "Spray" form, it is explicitly stated as "Não inflamável". The term "Spray" does not automatically mean "Aerosol spray" or "pressurized container" as per the Hazmat definition; it could be a pump spray. Without explicit indication of it being an aerosol or highly hazardous (corrosive/toxic), and given its non-flammable nature, it's considered a common household cleaning product.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

33. **MLB24631703 - Periovet Spray 100 Ml - Vetnil - Tratamento Tartaro Sabor Menta**

It is a pet care product, typically formulated to be safe for application. No indication of flammability, corrosivity, or high toxicity. It falls under "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" in a broader sense for pets.
    *   **Conclusion**: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **Analysis**: This product is a "grease melting cleaner" in sprayer form. It states "É inflamável: Não".
    *   **Hazmat Check**: The description "Derrete Gordura" (melts grease) indicates a strong chemical action, suggesting it may contain strong alkaline components.

Batch 25:
Here's a detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

For each product, I analyze its title and attributes to identify key characteristics. I then compare these characteristics against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on:
*   **Hazardous properties:** radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic.
*   **Specific material classes:** Class 1 (Explosives), Class 2 (Gases), Class 3 (Flammable Liquids), Class 4 (Flammable Solids), Class 5 (Oxidizing Agents and Organic Peroxides), Class 6 (Toxic and Infectious Substances), Class 7 (Radioactive Substances), Class 8 (Corrosive Substances), Class 9 (Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances).
*   **HAZMAT Indicators:** Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners), Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers, Automotive chemicals (paints, thinners, sealants), Industrial chemicals and reagents, Batteries (when sold separately), Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances, Products requiring safety warnings.
*   **NON-HAZMAT Indicators:** Food and beverages, Complete electronic devices (phones, computers), Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather), Basic tools and hardware, Office supplies, Personal care items (non-aerosol), Furniture and home goods.

If a product explicitly states "inflamável" (flammable) or contains a substance known to be corrosive, toxic, or an aerosol/pressurized container, it is classified as Hazmat. For chemical products, I consider their typical hazard profile based on their common use and compare them to the examples provided in the definition. If no clear hazardous property is indicated and it falls under a general non-Hazmat category, it is classified as non-Hazmat.

Batch 28:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **PRODUCT_ID: MLB19512869**
    *   **Title:** 'Innovator Base Relaxante Sodium 250g'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Título manual': 'Innovator Base Relaxante Sodium 250g', 'Marca': 'Itallian Hairtech', 'Tipo de produto': 'Relaxante', 'Tipo de cuidado': 'Relaxante, Alisamento'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** Hair relaxers, especially those containing "Sodium" (likely sodium hydroxide, also known as caustic soda), are known to be strong alkaline chemicals. Sodium hydroxide is explicitly listed in the Hazmat definition as an alkali, which is a corrosive substance (Class 8). Corrosive substances pose a risk to health (can dissolve organic tissue).
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Confidence:** High

2.  **PRODUCT_ID: MLB19720506**
    *   **Title:** 'Creme Esfoliante Corporal Raavi Neutro 1 Kg Wxz'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Título manual': 'Creme Esfoliante Corporal Raavi Neutro 1 Kg Wxz', 'Tipo de produto': 'Creme', 'Funções do produto': 'Limpeza da Pele e Remoção de células mortas'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a body exfoliating cream, a standard personal care item. There is no indication of any hazardous characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or being a pressurized container. It falls under "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" which is a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

3.  **PRODUCT_ID: MLB32399379**
    *   **Title:** 'Cartucho Smart Pen 36 Agulhas - Caixa Com 10 Agulhas - Smart GR'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Modelo': 'Cartucho Smart Derma Pen Preto', 'Quantidade de agulhas': '36', 'Material das agulhas': 'Titânio'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** These are new needles for a cosmetic device. While sharp objects can pose a physical hazard, the Hazmat definition focuses on chemical, biological, radioactive, explosive, or gaseous properties. "Used intravenous needles" are listed as biohazardous, but these are new and do not indicate a biohazard or any other hazardous material class. It falls under "Basic tools and hardware" which is a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

4.  **PRODUCT_ID: MLB21003763**
    *   **Title:** 'Loção Facial 3 Em 1 Fps 30 Urby Men 60ml Mantecorp Skincare'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Nome': 'Loção Facial Urby Men 3 em 1 FPS30 60ml', 'Formato do produto': 'Loção', 'Com proteção solar': 'Sim', 'FPS': '30'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a facial lotion with SPF, a common personal care product. There is no indication of any hazardous characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or being a pressurized container. It falls under "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" which is a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

5.  **PRODUCT_ID: MLB41925907**
    *   **Title:** 'Deo Colônia Florasense Rose 25ml - Jequiti'

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

96. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB27765489**
    *   **Title:** 'Gloss Too Faced Lip Injection Extreme Strawberry Kiss Cor Vermelho'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Modelo': 'Lip Injection Extreme', 'É engrossador': 'Sim'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a lip gloss designed for plumping ("engrossador"). While it may cause a temporary sensation, there is no indication it contains corrosive, toxic, or other Hazmat-classified substances. It's a standard personal care item.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

97. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB19638957**
    *   **Title:** 'Máscara Amend Millenar Óleos Indianos 300g'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Tipo de produto': 'Máscara', 'Formato': 'Creme'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a hair mask, a standard personal care item. There is no indication of any hazardous characteristics such as flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or being a pressurized container. It falls under "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" which is a non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

98. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB20637262**
    *   **Title:** 'Óleo De Ozônio Super Concentrado Ozonioterapia 30ml'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Nome': 'Óleo de Girassol Ozonizado', 'Formato do produto': 'Óleo', 'Funções do produto': 'Saúde_Beleza_da_Pele, Auxilia na Cicatrização, Tratamento de feridas, cortes e machucados, Dermatite, Eczemas, Assaduras, Queimaduras, Manchas de Pele, Pé e Calcanhar Rachado, Previne e Combate Bactérias Fungos (Inclusive nas Unhas)'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** "Óleo De Ozônio Super Concentrado Ozonioterapia" indicates the presence of ozonated oil. Ozone (O3) is a powerful oxidizing agent. While it's in an oil form, the "Super Concentrado" and explicit mention of "Ozone" (which is an oxidizer) strongly suggest it retains oxidizing properties. Oxidizing agents are classified as Class 5 Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Contains ozonated oil, which is an oxidizing agent (Class 5).
    *   **Confidence:** High

99. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB19057628**
    *   **Title:** 'TRUSS Uso Obrigatório 260ml  Reconstrutor Capilar Multifuncional | Nova Fórmula 2025 com Proteção Térmica, Brilho e Força Instantânea'
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Tipo de produto': 'Spray', 'Formato': 'Líquido', 'Apresentação': 'Spray'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a hair reconstructor in a "spray" format. The Hazmat definition specifies "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers." If this is a non-aerosol pump spray, it is not Hazmat. Without the explicit mention of "aerosol" or "pressurized," it is generally assumed to be a non-aerosol pump spray.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

100. **PRODUCT_ID: MLB19587753**
    *   **Title:** "L'oréal Professionnel Absolut Repair Gold Quinoa Óleo Capilar 90ml"
    *   **Attributes:** "{'Tipo de produto': 'Óleo', 'Formato': 'Óleo'}"
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a hair oil. Similar to other cosmetic oils, it generally has a high flash point and is not classified as a flammable liquid under Hazmat regulations. No other hazardous characteristics are indicated.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

Batch 29:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product:

1.  **MLB19309653: Gel Kérastase Curl Manifesto Gelée Curl Contour 150ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is described as a "Gel creme" for hair, a standard personal care item. There are no attributes indicating flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or being a pressurized container. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

2.  **MLB29147761: Gloss Labial Extreme Shine Volume Essence Cor Volume 102**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a standard "Gloss Labial" (lip gloss), a cosmetic product. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.

Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). Additionally, "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" are explicitly listed as Hazmat indicators (Class 2). Given it's a spray containing alcohol, it falls under the definition of a flammable liquid or a pressurized container.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Contains alcohol and is in spray format, indicating a flammable liquid (Class 3) or a pressurized container (Class 2).
    *   **Confidence:** High

4.  **MLB27511627: Kit Argan Hidratação Extrema e Nutrição Coiffer 3un**
    *   **Reasoning:** This kit contains "Shampoo / Mascara / Oleo" (shampoo, mask, oil), which are standard hair care products. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

5.  **MLB21324841: Sérum Facial 3 Em 1 Max Love Pele Hidratada Macia e Iluminada**

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

8.  **MLB19512692: Gel de Contato Neutro Corporal Raavi**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Gel de Contato Neutro Corporal" (neutral body contact gel) used as a conductor for aesthetic devices. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

9.  **MLB37093380: Kit 2 Caixas Microcânula Sc22g 50mm (cx C/10) Smart Gr**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Micro Cânula," a medical/aesthetic tool. The Hazmat definition lists "Used intravenous needles" as biohazardous (Class 6). However, these are new, non-contaminated cannulas and are not explicitly listed as Hazmat. They are tools, not chemical substances.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

10. **MLB19587756: Alfaparf Semi Di Lino Reconstruction Mascara Profissional**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Mascara Profissional" (professional hair mask). There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

11. **MLB35194148: Hidratante Facial Antimanchas Oil Control 89ml Cetaphil**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Hidratante Facial" (facial moisturizer), a standard cosmetic product. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.

12. **MLB19558426: Boticário Boticollection Thaty Deo Colônia 100ml**

Given the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator, it is classified as non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

13. **MLB19822553: Wella Professionals Invigo Nutri-enrich - Máscara 150ml**

While related to chemical hair treatments, these specific products (shampoo, conditioner, mask) are for after-care and are not typically hazardous themselves. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.

Therefore, it falls under "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

79. **MLB35946907: Diluidor Amor Creme Multifuncional Hidratante - 150ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Creme Diluidor" (diluting cream) for hair. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

80. **MLB43762584: Richée Bioplástica Capilar Escova Progressiva (2 X 300ml)**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "Escova Progressiva" (progressive brush/straightening) and "Bioplástica Capilar". Similar to MLB19512871 and MLB19513771, these types of hair treatments often involve strong chemicals like formaldehyde or its derivatives. The nature of the product implies the use of hazardous chemical ingredients that can be toxic or irritating. It falls under "Chemical products" or "Products requiring safety warnings".
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Product for "progressive straightening" and "bioplastics" implies the use of strong chemicals for hair alteration, which can be toxic or irritating (Class 6).
    *   **Confidence:** Medium

81. **MLB42451152: Colônia Celso Portiolli Titanium Essence 100ml - Jequiti**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Colônia" (cologne) with a volume of "100 mL". Colognes typically contain a significant percentage of alcohol, making them flammable liquids (Class 3). While "spray" is not explicitly mentioned, it's the common application for such products, and the alcohol content alone is sufficient for classification as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** As a "Colônia" of 100ml, it almost certainly contains alcohol and is a flammable liquid (Class 3).
    *   **Confidence:** High

82. **MLB26036014: Kit Arvensis Cachos Mascara 2x1 Noo Poo 450g 2 Unidades**
    *   **Reasoning:** This kit contains "Mascara" (hair masks). There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

83. **MLB24301023: ISDIN Creme Anti-Idade para Pele Sensível Isdinceutics Hyaluronic Moisture Sensitive Skin - 50g**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Creme Anti-Idade" (anti-aging cream) containing Hyaluronic Acid. These are common cosmetic ingredients and are not considered hazardous substances. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

84. **MLB40658753: Rabanne Million Gold Edp Intense - Perfume Masculino 200ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an "Eau de parfum" with "Formato de aplicação: Spray" and the attribute "É livre de álcool: Sim" (meaning it contains alcohol). Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). Given it's a spray containing alcohol, it falls under the definition of a flammable liquid or a pressurized container.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Contains alcohol and is in spray format, indicating a flammable liquid (Class 3) or a pressurized container (Class 2).
    *   **Confidence:** High

85. **MLB19722181: Sérum Fluído Melange Especial 50ml Lakma Fator Crescimento Tipo de pele Normal**

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

86. **MLB32463537: Pigmento Mag Color Micropigmentação E Microblading Cor Avelã 15 ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Pigmento" for "Micropigmentação E Microblading". Pigments used for permanent or semi-permanent tattooing/micropigmentation can sometimes contain heavy metals or other chemical compounds that may be toxic or allergenic, posing health risks, especially if not regulated or if they contain prohibited substances. The definition includes "toxic" and "allergenic" as hazardous characteristics (Class 6). Given the application, there's a potential for hazardous components.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Professional micropigmentation pigment may contain substances that are toxic or allergenic, posing a risk to health (Class 6).
    *   **Confidence:** Medium

87. **MLB27810400: Kit Lacan Liss Progress Shampoo Condicionador Mascara**
    *   **Reasoning:** This kit contains "Shampoo Condicionador Mascara" for hair. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

88. **MLB27573148: Deo Colônia Athina Lata Ciclo 100ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Deo Colônia" with "Formato de aplicação: Spray". While "É livre de álcool" is not specified, "Deo Colônia" and "Spray" format typically imply alcohol content and/or a pressurized container. Given the examples provided (like aerosol deodorant), such products are generally classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** As a "Deo Colônia" in spray format, it almost certainly contains alcohol and is a flammable liquid (Class 3) or a pressurized container (Class 2).

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

90. **MLB6072142: Paco Rabanne Lady Million EDP 50ml para feminino**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an "Eau de parfum" with "Formato de aplicação: Spray" and the attribute "É livre de álcool: Não" (meaning it contains alcohol). Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). Given it's a spray containing alcohol, it falls under the definition of a flammable liquid or a pressurized container.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Contains alcohol and is in spray format, indicating a flammable liquid (Class 3) or a pressurized container (Class 2).
    *   **Confidence:** High

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

92. **MLB6290388: Perfume Feminino Cuté Woman Eau De Parfum 100ml La Rive**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an "Eau De Parfum" with a volume of "100 mL" and the attribute "É livre de álcool: Não" (meaning it contains alcohol). Eau de parfum typically contains a significant percentage of alcohol, making it a flammable liquid (Class 3). While "spray" is not explicitly mentioned, it's the common application for such products, and the alcohol content alone is sufficient for classification as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** As an "Eau de parfum" of 100ml, it almost certainly contains alcohol and is a flammable liquid (Class 3).
    *   **Confidence:** High

93. **MLB26080271: Óleo Finalizador Extraordinário Tratamento Sublime Nutrição 100ml Elseve**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an "Óleo Finalizador" (finishing oil) for hair. Natural oils are generally not hazardous. There are no attributes indicating flammability or other Hazmat properties. It falls under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

94. **MLB19792229: Aneethun Force System Máscara Fortalecedora Litro Full**

    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

96. **MLB19314320: Truss Professional Night Spa Serum 250 ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Sérum" for hair with "Apresentação: Spray". Similar to other personal care sprays, if it's a non-aerosol pump spray and doesn't contain flammable alcohol (which is not indicated), it's not Hazmat. There are no attributes indicating hazardous properties.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

97. **MLB45749853: Malina Divina Blindagem - Efeito Chapinha Não Sai Com água**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Blindagem" (hair shielding/sealing) treatment. This implies a chemical hair treatment for smoothing or protection. While less aggressive than "progressive straightening," it involves chemical processes. Without specific hazardous ingredients mentioned, it's difficult to be certain. However, professional hair treatments often contain ingredients that could be irritants or sensitizers. Given the definition's broad scope for "chemical products" and "products requiring safety warnings", it's safer to classify it as Hazmat with low confidence.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Professional hair treatment product that likely contains chemicals for hair alteration, potentially posing health risks (Class 6).
    *   **Confidence:** Low

98. **MLB24734436: Gel Pedra Pierry Lohan 500g Original Em 24hrs C/ Nota**

    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an "Eau De Parfum" with "Formato de aplicação: Spray" and the attribute "É livre de álcool: Não" (meaning it contains alcohol). Alcohol is a flammable liquid (Class 3). Given it's a spray containing alcohol, it falls under the definition of a flammable liquid or a pressurized container.

Batch 30:
Here's a detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the hazardous characteristics (radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic) and specific examples/indicators.

**Key considerations:**
*   **Perfumes/Colognes/Body Sprays:** These items are generally classified as Class 3 Flammable Liquids due to their alcohol content, especially if the "É livre de álcool" (Is alcohol-free) attribute is "Não" (No) or missing (implying alcohol presence). The "Spray" format, while not always an aerosol, is often associated with the application of these flammable liquids.
*   **Aerosol Sprays:** The definition explicitly lists "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" under Class 2 Gases as Hazmat indicators.
*   **Chemical Treatments (e.g., Hair Straighteners):** Products like "Progressiva" (hair straightening treatments) can sometimes contain hazardous chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) that are toxic or corrosive, even if not explicitly stated in the attributes. This would fall under Class 6 Toxic Substances or Class 8 Corrosive Substances.
*   **General Personal Care Items (Creams, Lotions, Shampoos, Oils, Gels, Lip Gloss):** Unless they contain specific hazardous ingredients (e.g., strong acids, peroxides in high concentration, or are aerosols), these are typically non-Hazmat, falling under the "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" non-Hazmat indicator.
*   **Electronic Devices/Tools:** These fall under "Complete electronic devices" or "Basic tools and hardware" and are generally non-Hazmat.

```

Batch 32:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

For each product, I will analyze the product title and attributes, comparing them against the provided Hazmat definition and examples. Key indicators for Hazmat classification include:
*   **Class 2 (Gases):** Aerosol sprays, pressurized containers.
*   **Class 3 (Flammable Liquids):** Products containing alcohol (especially perfumes, colognes, sprays), solvents, paints, thinners.
*   **Class 5 (Oxidizing Agents):** Substances like strong peroxides or materials that contribute to combustion.
*   **Class 8 (Corrosive Substances):** Acids or alkalis that can dissolve tissue or corrode metals.
*   **General Hazmat Indicators:** Chemical products, products requiring safety warnings, and substances explicitly listed as dangerous.
*   **Non-Hazmat Indicators:** Personal care items (non-aerosol), complete electronic devices, food, basic tools, natural materials.

If a product contains "Spray" in its format or application, and it's a perfume/cologne/hairspray, it's generally assumed to contain alcohol and/or be a pressurized aerosol unless explicitly stated as "alcohol-free" and clearly a non-pressurized pump. If a product is explicitly stated as "alcohol-free" for perfumes/colognes, it is classified as Non-Hazmat unless other hazardous properties are evident.

Batch 33:
Here's the classification of the provided products based on the Hazmat definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Identify Flammable Liquids (Class 3):** Perfumes, colognes, eau de toilettes, and eau de parfums typically contain a high percentage of alcohol, making them flammable liquids. The presence of "É livre de álcool: Não" (Is alcohol-free: No) explicitly confirms alcohol content for several items. Pure essential oils are also considered flammable liquids.
2.  **Identify Toxic Substances (Class 6):** Products explicitly stating "Com Formol" (With Formaldehyde) are classified as Hazmat because formaldehyde is a toxic substance.
3.  **Identify Gases (Class 2):** Any product explicitly identified as an "Aerosol" is classified as Hazmat due to being a pressurized container containing gas.
4.  **Identify Corrosive Substances (Class 8):** Substances explicitly named as "Ácido" (Acid) in a concentration that suggests potential for harm, even if cosmetic, are considered. For cosmetic acids (like Glycolic Acid or Lactic Acid), the classification leans towards Hazmat if the concentration is noted as "Puro" or "Ativo" and the general category of "Acids" is listed as corrosive. However, many cosmetic products containing acids in lower, consumer-safe concentrations are typically not Hazmat. I will err on the side of caution for "pure" acid concentrations.
5.  **Identify other Chemical Products with potential hazards:** Glues/adhesives can sometimes contain flammable or irritating solvents. Without explicit chemical details, this can be a "medium confidence" Hazmat.
6.  **Non-Hazmat Classification:** Most other beauty products like shampoos, conditioners, creams, lotions, non-aerosol oils, masks, tonics, exfoliants (unless containing high concentrations of strong acids), and tools are generally classified as non-Hazmat, as they fall under "Personal Care items (non-aerosol)" and do not present the specific risks (explosive, radioactive, highly toxic, severely corrosive, etc.) defined for Hazmat.

Batch 34:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I have evaluated each product against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on key indicators such as:
*   **Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers:** These are explicitly listed as Hazmat.
*   **Flammable liquids:** Products containing alcohol (like perfumes, colognes, EDTs, unless explicitly stated as alcohol-free and non-spray) or concentrated essential oils are considered.
*   **Chemical products:** Items like hair dyes/toners, strong chemical treatments (e.g., for hair straightening), and pure chemical compounds for specific treatments (e.g., strong acids/bases, certain active ingredients in concentrated form) are flagged.
*   **Toxic/Allergenic substances:** Pigments for tattooing/micropigmentation are considered due to potential hazardous components.
*   **Corrosive substances:** While some cosmetics contain acids (e.g., hyaluronic, salicylic, vitamin C), they are generally in low, non-corrosive concentrations for personal care and are not considered Hazmat unless specified otherwise or if they are industrial-grade chemicals.
*   **Non-Hazmat categories:** Personal care items (non-aerosol), complete electronic devices, basic tools, and general home goods are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat.

Based on this, here's the classification:

Batch 35:
Here's the classification of each product, based on the provided Hazmat definition:

### Reasoning Process:

I will categorize each product based on its description and attributes, cross-referencing with the Hazmat definition and examples. Key indicators for Hazmat classification include:
*   **Flammable Liquids (Class 3):** Products containing alcohol (like perfumes, colognes, and some sprays) are generally considered flammable liquids.
*   **Gases (Class 2):** Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers.
*   **Toxic/Infectious/Allergenic (Class 6/9):** Substances that can cause serious health risks, including highly allergenic materials (like some tattoo pigments).
*   **Corrosive (Class 8):** Acids or alkalis that can dissolve tissue or corrode metals.
*   **Other specific hazardous characteristics** mentioned in the definition (explosive, radioactive, oxidizing, spontaneously combustible, dangerous when wet, etc.).

For non-Hazmat classification, I look for products that are clearly standard personal care items (creams, lotions, non-aerosol sprays, oils, shampoos, etc.), complete electronic devices, or basic tools/hardware, without any explicit hazardous properties.

Here's the individual analysis for each product:

1.  **MLB19085683 - Deo Parfum Natura Homem Tato 100 Ml**: This is a Deo Parfum (perfume) and the attributes state "É livre de álcool": 'Não', meaning it contains alcohol. Perfumes with alcohol are classified as Flammable Liquids (Class 3).
2.  **MLB27509896 - Colônia Lyra Joy 75ml Eudora**: This is an "Eau de cologne" with "Formato de aplicação: Spray". Colognes typically contain alcohol and are flammable liquids, falling under Class 3.
3.  **MLB26400689 - Aquecedor De Gel Ultrassom Óleo De Massagem Bivolt Mega Bell**: This is an "Aquecedor" (heater) for gel/massage oil. The product itself is an appliance, and the massage oil is a standard personal care item, not indicated as flammable or otherwise hazardous. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.
4.  **MLB19475775 - Perfume Feminino Natura Kaiak Aventura 100ml**: This is a "Deo-colônia" and the attributes state "É livre de álcool": 'Não', meaning it contains alcohol. Similar to other perfumes/colognes, it's a Flammable Liquid (Class 3).
5.  **MLB19848631 - Bioderma Pigmentbio Daily Care Fps 50+ 40ml**: This is a facial cream. It's a standard personal care item and does not indicate any hazardous properties. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.
6.  **MLB23224981 - Óleo de Rosa Mosqueta 30ml Bellaphytus**: This is a personal care oil. Unless specified as highly flammable (which is not indicated for rosehip oil), cosmetic oils are not Hazmat. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.
7.  **MLB30482990 - Kit 10 Agulhas Cartucho Caneta Derma Pen Nano Ponta**: These are needles made of titanium. They are basic tools/hardware and do not pose a Hazmat risk. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.

While some hair styling products are aerosols, this description indicates it's a liquid in a bottle, not a pressurized container. It's a standard personal care item. Therefore, it's non-Hazmat.

14. **MLB21555259 - Fluido Vitamina C 35% Lakma (passo 4) 50ml**: This is a facial serum containing Vitamin C.

Batch 37:
Here's the classification for each product based on the provided Hazmat definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

For each product, I examined the title and attributes to identify any characteristics that align with the Hazmat definition, specifically looking for:
*   **Class 1: Explosives** (e.g., fireworks, ammunition, detonators)
*   **Class 2: Gases** (e.g., aerosols, compressed gases, poisonous gases)
*   **Class 3: Flammable Liquids** (e.g., gasoline, alcohol, paint, thinner, varnish)
*   **Class 4: Flammable Solids** (e.g., sulfur, phosphorus, substances dangerous when wet)
*   **Class 5: Oxidizing Agents and Organic Peroxides** (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, peroxides)
*   **Class 6: Toxic and Infectious Substances** (e.g., insecticides, rat poison, formaldehyde, biohazardous materials)
*   **Class 7: Radioactive Substances** (e.g., uranium, plutonium)
*   **Class 8: Corrosive Substances** (e.g., acids, alkalis, automotive batteries)
*   **Class 9: Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances** (e.g., lithium batteries *when sold separately*, asbestos, dry ice, lead-based paint).

I also paid attention to the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" provided. A key distinction for batteries is whether they are "sold separately" (Hazmat) or integrated into "complete electronic devices" (Non-Hazmat).

Batch 4:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

The classification is based on the provided Hazmat definition, which identifies substances posing risks to health, safety, property, or the environment due to characteristics like flammability, explosiveness, corrosivity, toxicity, or being compressed gases/liquids. Key indicators for Hazmat include chemical products, aerosol sprays, automotive chemicals, industrial chemicals, **batteries (when sold separately)**, flammable/corrosive/toxic substances, and products requiring safety warnings. Conversely, non-Hazmat indicators include complete electronic devices (like phones, computers), natural materials, basic tools and hardware, office supplies, personal care items (non-aerosol), furniture, and home goods.

For each product, I will examine its title and attributes to determine if it contains or is primarily composed of any materials or characteristics listed as Hazmat. A particular focus will be on batteries, especially Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which are explicitly mentioned as Hazmat when sold separately and are common in power tools. While power tools themselves are generally not Hazmat, the presence of integrated or included Li-ion batteries often renders the entire product Hazmat for transport purposes.

1.  **MLB39204211: Furadeira Parafusadeira Com Kit Brocas, Bits E Trena Vonder PFV 012**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a cordless drill/driver. The attributes clearly state it is "Bateria" (battery) powered and "Inclui bateria" (includes battery). While the type of battery isn't explicitly Li-ion, modern power tool batteries are almost exclusively Li-ion. The definition lists "Batteries (when sold separately)" as a HAZMAT indicator, and battery-powered tools are often treated as Hazmat due to the inherent risks of the batteries.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.

2.  **MLB47179359: Filtro Ar 1/4 Eliminador De Ãgua Suporte PressÃ£o Compressor**

Batch 6:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product as Hazmat or Non-Hazmat based on the provided definition and examples. The key indicators for Hazmat are substances that are radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, and also compressed gases/liquids or hot materials. Specific examples include various chemical products, aerosol sprays, pressurized containers, automotive chemicals, industrial chemicals, **batteries (when sold separately)**, flammable/corrosive/toxic substances, and products requiring safety warnings. Non-Hazmat indicators include food, complete electronic devices (phones, computers), natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, furniture, and non-chemical automotive parts.

A crucial point for power tools is the presence of batteries. The definition explicitly lists "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat. While complete electronic devices like phones are listed as non-hazmat, power tools containing Li-ion batteries are often treated differently for shipping due to the higher energy density and potential risks of these batteries, especially if they are large or multiple. I will classify products containing Li-ion batteries as Hazmat, even if integrated into a tool, as the battery itself is the hazardous component and the tool is not a "complete electronic device" in the same vein as a phone or computer for which a blanket non-hazmat rule applies. For batteries where the type isn't explicitly "Li-ion" but the voltage and context (cordless power tool) strongly suggest it, I will classify as Hazmat with medium confidence.

Here's the classification for each product:

1.  **MLB42796080: Calibrador E Inflador De Pneus Com ManÃ´metro 220 Libras**
    *   This is a basic tool for tire maintenance. It does not contain any hazardous chemicals or pressurized gases as part of the product itself.

Batch 18:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I first reviewed the provided `<hazmat_definition>` thoroughly, paying close attention to the nine classes of hazardous materials (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances) and the examples given for each. I also noted the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators."

2.  **Product by Product Analysis:** For each product, I followed these steps:
    *   **Identify Product Type:** Determined what the product is (e.g., supplement, book, medical device, chemical).
    *   **Check for Hazmat Characteristics:** Compared the product's nature, ingredients, and form (liquid, gas, aerosol, solid, etc.) against the Hazmat definition and examples.
    *   **Consult Indicators:** Specifically looked for matches with "HAZMAT Indicators" such as "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)," "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers," "Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances," or "Oxidizing Agents."
    *   **Consult Non-Hazmat Examples:** Checked if the product clearly falls into "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" like "Food and beverages," "Complete electronic devices," "Natural materials," or "Personal care items (non-aerosol)."
    *   **Determine Classification:**
        *   If a clear Hazmat characteristic was identified (e.g., aerosol, oxidizing agent), classified as Hazmat.
        *   If it fell into a non-Hazmat category or lacked any hazardous properties according to the definition, classified as Non-Hazmat.
        *   For ambiguous cases, I erred on the side of caution but considered the product's common use and safety profile (e.g., mild vs. strong chemicals).

**Classification Results:**

Batch 20:
Here's the detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on characteristics such as flammability, toxicity, corrosivity, explosiveness, and whether it's a compressed gas/liquid or contains radioactive, oxidizing, or biohazardous substances. I will also refer to the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" in the definition.

1.  **Product ID: MLB36588575**
    *   **Title:** Neutrofer Folato D 90 Comprimidos Sabor Sem Sabor
    *   **Attributes:** Nutritional supplement (Metilfolato, Acetato de DL-alfa tocoferol) in tablet form.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a dietary supplement. Nutritional supplements are not listed as hazardous materials in the provided definition or examples. They do not exhibit characteristics of explosives, flammable liquids/solids, gases, oxidizing agents, toxic/infectious substances, radioactive, or corrosive materials.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

2.  **Product ID: MLB37271827**
    *   **Title:** Compressa CirÃºrgica Campo OperatÃ³rio 45x50 C/50 - Nobre
    *   **Attributes:** Surgical compress made of cotton.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a basic medical supply made of natural material (cotton). It is not a chemical, gas, explosive, or radioactive material. It falls under "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)" or general medical supplies which are not Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

3.  **Product ID: MLB35048029**
    *   **Title:** Kit 108 Adesivos Repelente Infantil E Adulto Mosquito Dengue Cor Multicolorido Diverso
    *   **Attributes:** Repellent stickers with "Ãleo de citronela" (Citronella oil) as the active ingredient.
    *   **Analysis:** Citronella oil is a natural essential oil used as a repellent. While some pesticides are Hazmat, a repellent based on citronella oil in sticker form is typically not considered a toxic substance that would cause "death or serious injury if inhaled, swallowed, or by skin absorption" or "harmful to human health" in the context of Hazmat classification. It's a personal care item.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

4.  **Product ID: MLB32099104**
    *   **Title:** Oregano Desidratado 1 Kg
    *   **Attributes:** Dried oregano, a spice/food item.
    *   **Analysis:** "Food and beverages" are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

5.  **Product ID: MLB36461436**
    *   **Title:** Amor Em 12 Perguntas, De Topaz Adizes. Editorial Harlequin Books, Tapa Mole, EdiÃ§Ã£o 1 Em PortuguÃªs, 2024
    *   **Attributes:** A book.
    *   **Analysis:** Books are not listed as hazardous materials and fall under general goods or "Office supplies" which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

6.  **Product ID: MLB45687980**
    *   **Title:** Exercitador Pulmonar Treinador RespiratÃ³rio ExercÃ­cio PulmÃ£o
    *   **Attributes:** Medical device for respiratory exercise, made of polypropylene.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a complete medical device/tool. It is not a hazardous substance or an article that presents a unique hazard during transport.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

7.  **Product ID: MLB19426895**
    *   **Title:** Manual de Reflexologia e Cromoterapia: Combinando as TÃ©cnicas Dessas Duas Modalidades de Cura com os Conhecimentos da Energia que Flui AtravÃ©s da Aura e dos Chakras, Wills Pauline. Editoria Pensamento
    *   **Attributes:** A book.
    *   **Analysis:** Books are not listed as hazardous materials and fall under general goods or "Office supplies" which are non-Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat.

8.  **Product ID: MLB21773913**
    *   **Title:** MÃ¡quina digital de mediÃ§Ã£o de pressÃ£o arterial

Batch 22:
Detailed reasoning process:

1.  **Analyze the Hazmat Definition:** I carefully reviewed the provided Hazmat definition, paying close attention to the nine classes of dangerous goods and the examples given for both Hazmat and Non-Hazmat items. Key indicators for Hazmat include being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, as well as compressed gases/liquids and hot materials. The examples further clarify specific substances (e.g., gasoline, sulfuric acid, lithium batteries when sold separately, aerosol sprays, pesticides, asbestos). Non-Hazmat indicators include food, complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, and non-aerosol personal care items.

2.  **Product-by-Product Classification:**

    *   **MLB40442951: Aparelho medidor de pressÃ£o arterial digital de braÃ§o Jziki ZK-B869 branco**
        *   Reasoning: This is a complete electronic device used for health monitoring. Although it includes batteries, the definition specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as Hazmat. As part of a complete device, it falls under the "Complete electronic devices" non-Hazmat category.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB22263543: Compressa De Gaze NÃ£o EstÃ©ril 13 Fios Pacote 500 Un./350grs**
        *   Reasoning: This product is non-sterile gauze made of cotton. Cotton is explicitly listed as a "Natural material" which is a non-Hazmat indicator. It does not possess any hazardous characteristics like flammability (unless treated), toxicity, or corrosivity.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB19549139: Collagen Protein Neutro 450ml Puravida Sabor Puro**
        *   Reasoning: This is a collagen protein supplement in powder form. Nutritional supplements are not listed as Hazmat and do not fall into any of the hazardous classes (explosives, gases, flammable, toxic, corrosive, etc.). It's akin to food or non-aerosol personal care items.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB19287702: A alma indomÃ¡vel: Como se libertar dos pensamentos, emoÃ§Ãµes e energias que bloqueiam a consciÃªncia, de Singer, Michael A.. Editorial Editora Sextante, capa mole em portuguÃªs, 2018**
        *   Reasoning: This is a book. Books are explicitly listed under "Office supplies" and "Furniture & Home Goods" as non-Hazmat indicators.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB37308344: Kit 12 Columax HÃ©rnia De Disco LetÃ­timo 100% Natural 15 CÃ¡ps Sabor Sem Sabor**
        *   Reasoning: This is a natural supplement in capsule form. Similar to the collagen protein, it's a nutritional supplement and does not fit any Hazmat criteria.

    *   **MLB48954861: Taurus 500ml VermifugaÃ§Ã£o Em Bovinos Ovinos E SuÃ­nos**
        *   Reasoning: This is a dewormer for animals in liquid form. The Hazmat definition includes "Toxic substances liable to cause death or serious injury if inhaled, swallowed, or by skin absorption" and lists "Pesticides" as an example. A dewormer (vermifuge) is designed to kill parasites and can be harmful if mishandled or ingested by humans or non-target animals, aligning with the definition of a toxic substance.
        *   Classification: Hazmat.

        *   Reasoning: The title explicitly states "Ãlcool 70Â°" (Alcohol 70%). Ethanol at 70% concentration has a flash point below 23Â°C, making it a Class 3 Flammable Liquid according to the definition (e.g., "Alcohol isopropÃ­lico 99% para limpeza eletrÃ´nicos 1L" is an example of Hazmat). The attribute "Ã inflamÃ¡vel": "NÃ£o" (Is flammable: No) is contradictory to the chemical properties of 70% alcohol and should be disregarded in favor of the substance's known hazard.
        *   Classification: Hazmat.
        *   Reason: Flammable liquid (Ethanol 70%).
        *   Confidence: High.

    *   **MLB21652882: Pielsana Polihexanida SoluÃ§Ã£o Aquosa 350ml**
        *   Reasoning: This is an aqueous solution of Polyhexanide (PHMB), an antiseptic. While a chemical, it is typically used for wound care and is not classified as a corrosive, flammable, or highly toxic substance for transport purposes at this concentration. It falls under non-aerosol personal care/medical items.

        *   Reasoning: This is a derma roller, a cosmetic/medical instrument with needles. The Hazmat definition lists "Used intravenous needles" as biohazardous, but this is a new, non-biohazardous device. It is not a hazardous substance.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB33301843: OrÃ©gano Desidratado 1kg Premium Alta Qualidade**
        *   Reasoning: This is dried oregano, a food item (spice). "Food and beverages" are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB28988249: Phenibut 400mg : 120 CÃ¡psulas Top Sabor**
        *   Reasoning: This is a Phenibut supplement in capsule form. While Phenibut can have psychoactive effects, it is sold as a dietary supplement. The Hazmat definition's examples for "Toxic substances" are strong industrial chemicals or highly poisonous substances (e.g., Potassium cyanide, Pesticides).

    *   **MLB22368027: Naftalina em bolas pura super concentrado pacote de 1Kg Boa Saude Sanilar**
        *   Reasoning: Naphthalene is a chemical known to be toxic if ingested or inhaled in sufficient quantities. It sublimes at room temperature, releasing vapors that can be harmful and pose an asphyxiation risk in confined spaces. This aligns with the Hazmat definition of a "toxic" or "asphyxiating" substance. It is also a "chemical product that requires safety warnings."
        *   Classification: Hazmat.
        *   Reason: Toxic and potentially asphyxiating substance (Class 6 / Class 2 risk).
        *   Confidence: High.

        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB19695950: A Sutil Arte de Ligar o F*da-se Uma EstratÃ©gia Inusitada Para Uma Vida Melhor de Mark Manson Editorial Intrinseca Capa Mole ediÃ§Ã£o 1 em portuguÃªs 2017**

        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB19132263: Vinagre de Ãlcool Castelo Frasco 2l**
        *   Reasoning: This is alcohol vinegar. Vinegar, including alcohol vinegar, is a diluted acetic acid solution commonly used in food and cleaning. The definition explicitly lists "Organic apple cider vinegar" as non-Hazmat. It is not flammable, corrosive, or toxic in the concentrations found in household products.
        *   Classification: Non-Hazmat.

    *   **MLB21596888: Monitor De PressÃ£o Arterial Digital De BraÃ§o - Multi SaÃºde - Hc090**

        *   Reasoning: These are wipes saturated with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol at 70% is a flammable liquid (Class 3 Flammable Liquids, flash point below 23Â°C). The definition lists "99% isopropyl alcohol for electronics cleaning 1L" as a Hazmat example, and 70% also meets the flammability criteria. While individual wipes contain small amounts, the total quantity in 200 units poses a flammability risk for transport.

        *   Reason: Flammable liquid (isopropyl alcohol 70%).
        *   Confidence: High.

Batch 23:
Here's my detailed reasoning process and the Hazmat classification for each product:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product against the provided Hazmat definition, specifically looking for characteristics like:
*   Radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic.
*   Compressed gases/liquids or hot materials.
*   Specific examples provided in Classes 1-9 (e.g., aerosols, strong acids/alkalis, certain chemicals, batteries sold separately).
*   General Hazmat indicators like chemical products, aerosol sprays, industrial chemicals, batteries sold separately, flammable/corrosive/toxic substances, and products requiring safety warnings.
*   General Non-Hazmat indicators like food, complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, furniture, and non-chemical automotive parts.

---

**Product 1: MLB23871526 - ColchÃ£o PneumÃ¡tico OrtopÃ©dico Anti Escaras Dellamed AirPlus atÃ© 135kg 220V**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a pneumatic mattress with an air pump, designed as a home good/medical device. It uses air, not a hazardous gas, and is not a chemical, flammable, or otherwise hazardous material as per the definition. It falls under "Furniture and home goods" or "Complete electronic devices" (as a medical device).
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

**Product 2: MLB19148427 - G-Tech NEBMESH2 Inalador e Nebulizador De Rede VibratÃ³ria Branco**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a complete electronic medical device (inhaler/nebulizer). Although it uses AA batteries, these are standard batteries typically included within the device and do not classify the complete device as Hazmat based on the provided definition which specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as a Hazmat indicator.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

**Product 3: MLB19532824 - Nutrify - Green PrÃ³polis 60 CAPS - Suplemento Natural - Fortalece o Sistema ImunolÃ³gico - 60 CÃ¡psulas**
*   **Reasoning:** This is a natural dietary supplement in capsule form. Dietary supplements, unless containing specific hazardous ingredients in concentrations that pose a risk, are generally classified under "Food and beverages" or "Personal care items (non-aerosol)", both listed as Non-Hazmat. Propolis is a natural substance.
*   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

**Product 4: MLB51183406 - Percarbonato De SÃ³dio 100% Puro Tira Manchas Alvejante - 1kg**
*   **Reasoning:** Percarbonato de SÃ³dio (Sodium Percarbonate) is an "Alvejante" (bleach/whitener). The Hazmat definition explicitly lists "Hydrogen peroxide" as an example of a Class 5 "Oxidizing agent." Sodium percarbonate functions as an oxidizing agent by releasing hydrogen peroxide when mixed with water. Therefore, it aligns with the "Oxidizing Agents" category.
*   **Classification:** Hazmat

Batch 25:
Here's the detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I've carefully reviewed the provided definition, focusing on the nine classes of hazardous materials (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances) and the examples provided for each, as well as the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators."

2.  **Analyze Each Product:** For each product, I will examine its `TITLE` and `ATTRIBUTES` to identify any keywords, materials, or functionalities that align with the Hazmat definition or the non-Hazmat examples.

    *   **Chemical Composition:** Look for names of chemicals (e.g., acids, peroxides, specific elements/compounds).
    *   **Form/State:** Note if it's a gas (aerosol, compressed), liquid, or solid, and if its form implies a hazard (e.g., "spray paint" implies aerosol/flammable gas).
    *   **Hazardous Properties:** Identify terms like "flammable," "corrosive," "toxic," "oxidizing," "explosive," "radioactive," "poisonous," "biohazardous."
    *   **Product Type:** Categorize the product (e.g., food, electronics, personal care, industrial chemical, supplement).
    *   **Specific Examples:** Cross-reference with the Hazmat and non-Hazmat examples provided. For instance, "Batteries (when sold separately)" are Hazmat, but "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are non-Hazmat.

3.  **Determine Classification:**
    *   If a product clearly fits a Hazmat class or indicator, it will be classified as `is_hazmat: true`, with a `reason` and `confidence`.
    *   If a product clearly fits a non-Hazmat indicator or is a common consumer item with no stated hazardous properties, it will be classified as `is_hazmat: false`.
    *   If there's ambiguity, I will err on the side of caution (Hazmat with lower confidence) as per the guidelines: "If not certain of the classification, output as hazmat with lower confidence." However, I will also leverage the "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" which are quite broad (e.g., "Personal care items (non-aerosol)").

Batch 27:
Here's a detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

**Hazmat Classification Reasoning:**

The classification is based on the provided Hazmat definition, which categorizes substances posing risks to health, safety, property, or the environment. Key indicators include flammability, explosiveness, corrosivity, toxicity, and being a compressed gas, oxidizing agent, or radioactive. The definition also explicitly lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)", "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers", "Automotive chemicals (paints, thinners, sealants)", "Industrial chemicals and reagents", "Batteries (when sold separately)", "Flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances", and "Products requiring safety warnings" as HAZMAT indicators. Non-Hazmat indicators include "Food and beverages", "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)", "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)", "Basic tools and hardware", "Office supplies", "Personal care items (non-aerosol)", and "Furniture and home goods".

1.  **MLB21346720 - Esparadrapo Industrial 10cm X 50m Missner Original 1 Rolo**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is described as "Esparadrapo" (adhesive plaster/surgical tape), made of "Esparadrapo". It's a basic medical supply item, essentially a fabric-based adhesive tape. It does not possess characteristics of being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic in a hazardous material sense. It is not a chemical product in the context of Hazmat classification, nor is it a pressurized container or a battery. It aligns with "Basic tools and hardware" or "Personal care items (non-aerosol)" which are non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

2.  **MLB30179180 - Farmina Pet Foods N&D White cachorros adultos 2kg**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "Farmina Pet Foods", which is pet food. The ingredients listed are food-grade components. The definition explicitly lists "Food and beverages" as Non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

3.  **MLB27453574 - Hyabak ColÃ­rio Frasco Com 10ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is "ColÃ­rio" (eye drops). The ingredient "Hialuronato de sÃ³dio" (Sodium Hyaluronate) is a common, non-hazardous substance used for lubrication in eye care. It falls under "Personal care items (non-aerosol)" which are Non-Hazmat indicators. It is not a strong chemical (acid, solvent, industrial cleaner) that would be classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

4.  **MLB35661191 - Vitamina K2 Mk7 - Kit 2x 120 Caps - Floral Ervas Do Brasil Sabor Sem Sabor**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a "Vitamina K2" supplement in capsule form. Nutritional supplements are generally considered non-hazardous for transport and do not fall into any of the Hazmat classes. They are similar to "Food and beverages" or "Personal care items (non-aerosol)".

Batch 37:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition and examples:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Understand the Hazmat Definition:** I first re-read the definition and the explicit examples of Hazmat and Non-Hazmat goods. Key categories for Hazmat are Explosives, Gases (flammable, non-flammable, poisonous), Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents & Organic Peroxides, Toxic & Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, and Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances (e.g., asbestos, dry ice, lithium batteries). The "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" sections are also crucial.

2.  **Analyze Each Product:** For each product, I examine its `TITLE` and `ATTRIBUTES` to identify its nature, primary function, and any specific characteristics (e.g., "spray," "liquid," "chemical," "flammable," "concentrated").

3.  **Cross-Reference with Definition/Examples:** I then compare these characteristics against the Hazmat definition and examples.
    *   If a product matches an explicit Hazmat example or indicator (e.g., "aerosol," "flammable liquid," "acid," "pesticide," "automotive chemical"), it's classified as Hazmat.
    *   If a product matches an explicit Non-Hazmat example or indicator (e.g., "food," "complete electronic device," "furniture," "book," "textile," "basic tool"), it's classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   For ambiguous cases, I consider the general risk posed by the substance type (e.g., concentrated cleaners are chemical products and can be irritants/corrosive, thus Hazmat). If in doubt and the product could potentially pose a risk, I lean towards Hazmat with a lower confidence if information is insufficient, but the guidelines state "If not certain of the classification, output as hazmat with lower confidence." However, it also states "Only output a product as non-hazmat if you are absolutely certain that it is not a Hazmat". This implies that if there's *any* characteristic that hints at hazmat, I should classify it as such.

Batch 39:
Here's the classification of the provided products based on the Hazmat definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

I have evaluated each product against the provided Hazmat definition, focusing on the nine classes of dangerous goods and the general indicators for Hazmat and Non-Hazmat items.

1.  **Food & Beverages:** Products clearly identified as food, beverages, or food supplements (e.g., Laranja Moro capsules, dried plum, olive oil, cocoa powder, peanuts, olives, spices) are classified as Non-Hazmat, as per the "Food & Beverages" non-Hazmat indicator.
2.  **Alcoholic Beverages:** Products like Vodka, Gin, Wine, and Irish Cream Liqueur are classified as Hazmat. Although not explicitly listed in the examples for Class 3, the definition states "Flammable Liquids" and provides examples like "Gasoline (petrol), Acetone". Alcoholic beverages with significant alcohol content (typically above 24% for spirits, and even lower for some wines) are considered flammable liquids due to their flash point. Given the examples of Class 3 and the general nature of these liquids, they pose a flammability risk.
3.  **Household Cleaners/Chemicals:**
    *   **Coperalcool Bacfree Panos Umedecidos 70Â°:** Contains 70% alcohol, which is a flammable liquid (related to Isopropyl Alcohol example in Class 3). Classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Ãleo De Peroba (furniture polish) and Lustra MÃ³veis:** These are chemical products often containing solvents or flammable components. "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" are Hazmat indicators. Classified as Hazmat with medium confidence, as specific flammability or toxicity data for "Peroba oil" isn't given, but it falls under general chemical products.
    *   **Kit Jimo GÃ¡s Fumegante Detetizador (Pesticide):** Explicitly contains "GÃ¡s Fumegante" and is a "Detetizador" (exterminator/pesticide). "Pesticides" are listed under Class 6: Toxic Substances. Classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Mata Baratas Francesinha Gel:** Explicitly a "Cockroach Killer" which falls under "Pesticides", a Class 6 Toxic Substance. Classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Removedor De Ceras:** "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" are Hazmat indicators. Wax removers typically contain strong solvents. Classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Limpador Perfumado Casa & Perfume Sensazione:** A "chemical cleaning product". Classified as Hazmat with medium confidence.
    *   **Limpador SapÃ³lio Radium ClÃ¡ssico Cremoso:** A "chemical cleaning product". Despite stating "Ã inflamÃ¡vel: NÃ£o", it's still a chemical cleaner and can pose risks (e.g., irritant, corrosive) as per the broader definition of Hazmat. Classified as Hazmat with medium confidence.
    *   **Spray De Ambientes Neutralizador Odores Lavanda & LÃ­rio Do Vale Bom Ar:** "Bom Ar" is a common brand for aerosol air fresheners. "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" are Hazmat indicators (Class 2 Gases). Classified as Hazmat.
    *   **Sem Passar Facilitador Neutralizador De Odor Baby Soft Spray:** The term "Spray" is used, but it does not specify "aerosol" or "pressurized". Assuming it's a non-aerosol pump spray, the liquid itself would need to be hazardous. Given it's a laundry aid/odor neutralizer, it's less likely to be inherently hazardous as a liquid compared to a strong cleaner or solvent. Therefore, classified as Non-Hazmat.

4.  **Electronics (Complete Devices) & Accessories:**
    *   **Aspirador De PÃ³ Mini Soprador 3em1 Usb Refil PortÃ¡til RecarregÃ¡vel:** A complete electronic device. It explicitly states "Com bateria de lÃ­tio: NÃ£o". "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)" are Non-Hazmat. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Sanduicheira elÃ©trica, Escova De Limpeza ElÃ©trica, Aquecedor ElÃ©trico, Grill E Sanduicheira:** These are complete electronic devices/home appliances. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Controle De Acesso Reconhecimento Facial App Face Id Agl, Switch 16 Portas Gigabit, Programador Para Motor Eletronico, Controle Remoto Para PortÃ£o EletrÃ´nico:** These are complete electronic devices or accessories. Batteries are included *within* the device, not sold separately, and are not specified as lithium, thus not Hazmat. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Torre De Tomada Multiplug:** An electronic accessory. Classified as Non-Hazmat.

5.  **Furniture & Home Goods (Non-Chemical):**
    *   **Jogo De Panelas, Conjunto De Panelas, Panela De InduÃ§Ã£o:** These are kitchenware. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **TermÃ´metro Ambiente:** A basic home good, not containing hazardous materials. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **BalcÃ£o Cooktop, Gabinete Banheiro, ArmÃ¡rio AÃ©reo, BalcÃ£o De Cozinha, Espelheira, Cozinha Compacta:** All types of furniture. "Furniture and home goods" are explicitly listed as Non-Hazmat. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Colcha, Cobre Leito, Tapete, Cortina:** These are textile items. "Clothing & Textiles" and "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)" are Non-Hazmat indicators. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Pano Para Limpeza:** A cleaning cloth. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Cinzeiro Vidro:** A home good. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Mesa TÃ¡bua De Passar Roupa:** A home good. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Arco Redondo Suporte DesmontÃ¡vel:** A decorative item/tool. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Kit De Gato Casa Casinha Parede Playground:** Pet furniture/home good. Classified as Non-Hazmat.

6.  **Tools & Hardware (Non-Chemical):**
    *   **Anilha Vazada Emborrachada:** Exercise equipment. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Parafuso Auto brocante:** Basic hardware. Classified as Non-Hazmat.
    *   **Etiquetadora manual:** Basic office tool. Classified as Non-Hazmat.

7.  **Office Supplies / Books:**
    *   **Almanaque Passatempo, Revista LiÃ§Ãµes BÃ­blicas, Patrulha Canina Prancheta, Livro Casas Estranhas:** Books/magazines/office supplies. Classified as Non-Hazmat.

Batch 42:
Here's a detailed reasoning process for each product's Hazmat classification:

1.  **MLB27838447: Kit 6 PeÃ§as Cobre Leito + Jogo De LenÃ§ol King Bordado Percal Cor Terracota 200 Fios Bordado Costurado**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a bedding set made of microfibers. It falls under the "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators in the provided definition. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics like flammability (beyond normal textiles), toxicity, or corrosiveness.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

2.  **MLB33979045: Gabinete ArmÃ¡rio Banheiro 80cm C/ RodÃ­zios MultimÃ³veis V5002 MÃ³vel Rustic/Branco**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a bathroom cabinet made of MDP. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

3.  **MLB20799377: Cera Para Piso De Madeira Resistente Brilhante - W&w 1l**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a floor wax. The Hazmat definition explicitly lists "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)" as Hazmat indicators. Floor waxes often contain solvents that can be flammable or otherwise hazardous. Without further information on its chemical composition, it's safer to classify it as Hazmat due to its nature as a chemical cleaning/treatment product.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Chemical product, likely contains flammable or harmful solvents.
    *   **Confidence:** High

4.  **MLB43869578: Kit Cobre Leito Colcha King 3 PÃ§s Percal 300 Fios Babadinhos Cor Verde**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a bedspread/quilt made of polyester. It falls under the "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

5.  **MLB19545869: XÃ´ Pombo Morcego Pardais Gel Repelente Quimiagri 250g**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a repellent gel. The Hazmat definition includes "Pesticides" as Class 6 Toxic substances. While described as a "repellent" rather than a "pesticide" (which usually implies killing), it is a chemical substance designed to deter pests (pigeons, bats, sparrows) by affecting them, implying potential toxicity or harm. Products that require safety warnings are also Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Chemical product designed to repel pests, potentially toxic or harmful.
    *   **Confidence:** High

6.  **MLB28450403: Colcha Solteiro 2 PeÃ§as Percal 300 Fios Basic Marinho Cor Azul-marinho**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a bedspread/quilt made of polyester. It falls under the "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

7.  **MLB34506386: Passadeira Corredor 2,00x0,60 Tapete Super Peludo Beira De Cama Sala Quarto Bege**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a rug/carpet made of polyester. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

8.  **MLB32669756: Afasta Gato E Gambas Espante Repelente Para Gatos 300g**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a repellent in tablet form for cats and possums. Similar to the previous repellent, it is a chemical product intended to deter animals and therefore likely contains substances that could be toxic or harmful. Products that require safety warnings are Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Chemical product designed to repel pests, potentially toxic or harmful.
    *   **Confidence:** High

9.  **MLB29472670: Cobre Leito Colcha Solteiro 2 PÃ§s Percal 300 Fios Basic RosÃª**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a bedspread/quilt made of polyester. It falls under the "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

10. **MLB29399395: Controle Remoto Para PortÃ£o EletrÃ´nico Rossi Hcs C/ Pilha**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a remote control, which is a complete electronic device. While it includes a battery ("C/ Pilha"), the Hazmat definition specifies "Batteries (when sold separately)" as a Hazmat indicator. Small, standard batteries (like AA/AAA or coin cells) included within a complete electronic device (like this remote) are generally not classified as Hazmat for transport unless they are large lithium-ion batteries or the device itself is a large battery pack. This product falls under "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)", which are non-Hazmat indicators.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

11. **MLB13471360: Pipoqueira Popflix Pp-03 1200w Vermelha Mondial**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a popcorn maker, which is a kitchen appliance. It falls under "Electronics (Complete Devices)" or "Furniture & Home Goods", both of which are listed as non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

12. **MLB19750305: PaÃ§oquita Diet Santa Helena Caixa C/24 Unidades - Atacado**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a food item (peanut candy). It falls under the "Food & Beverages" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

13. **MLB21440359: Gabinete Banheiro 2 Portas e 1 Gaveta RetrÃ´ 120cm MultimÃ³veis MP5025 Preto**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a bathroom cabinet made of MDP. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

14. **MLB32643222: Jogo De Panelas Tramontina Antiaderente Turim 10 PÃ§ Preto**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a cookware set made of aluminum with a non-stick coating. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category (specifically kitchenware), which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

15. **MLB41590148: Kit 3 D-fense PrÃ³ Ambiente Spray Moscas Mosquitos 250ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an insecticide spray. The Hazmat definition includes "Pesticides" under Class 6: Toxic substances. Additionally, "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" are explicitly listed as Hazmat indicators. This product matches both criteria.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Toxic substance (insecticide) and aerosol spray.
    *   **Confidence:** High

16. **MLB18308304: Espumante Branco Brut Casa Perini 750 ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an alcoholic beverage (sparkling wine) with 12% alcohol by volume. While alcohol is flammable, common consumer alcoholic beverages like wine and beer (typically below 24% ABV) are generally not classified as Hazmat for transport in consumer quantities due to their relatively high flash points compared to other flammable liquids. The definition explicitly lists "Food & Beverages" as non-Hazmat indicators, and the examples of flammable liquids provided are highly volatile substances like gasoline and acetone.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

17. **MLB33452976: Kit Cobre Leito Cama Casal Super King Percal 200fios Bordado Cor Rose Dupla Face Cama Alta Costurado**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a bedspread/quilt made of microfiber. It falls under the "Clothing & Textiles" or "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

18. **MLB47860411: Armario Balcao Gabinete Multiuso Cozinha Casa ServiÃ§o MÃ³veis Cor Cinamomo/off White**
    *   **Reasoning:** This is a kitchen/utility cabinet made of wood. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

19. **MLB19770797: Dimpless + Morosil 60 Caps | Sunfood Sem Sabor**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a dietary supplement in capsule form. It falls under "Food & Beverages" or "Personal Care (Non-Aerosol)" as a health supplement, both of which are non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

20. **MLB25492721: EnÃ©as, O Brasileiro Por ExcelÃªncia, De AndrÃ© Garcia Brito De Morais. SÃ©rie ClÃ¡ssicos Do Brasil, Vol. 1. Editora Viseu, Capa Mole, 1Âª EdiÃ§Ã£o 30 Maio 2022 Em PortuguÃªs, 2022**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a book. It falls under the "Office Supplies" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

21. **MLB17978854: Gin Rock's Doce 1 L strawberry**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an alcoholic beverage (Gin) with a high alcohol content of 38.5% by volume. Liquids with an alcohol content this high typically have a flash point below 23Â°C, which would classify them as Class 3 Flammable Liquids according to the Hazmat definition ("Flammable liquids with an initial boiling point greater than 35Â°C and a flash point less than 23Â°C"). Unlike wine, spirits like gin are often regulated as Hazmat due to their flammability.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Flammable liquid (high alcohol content, likely flash point below 23Â°C).
    *   **Confidence:** High

22. **MLB19742551: Espumante Casa Perini Black Edition - 750ml**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an alcoholic beverage (sparkling wine) with 12% alcohol by volume. Similar to MLB18308304, common consumer alcoholic beverages like wine are generally not classified as Hazmat in consumer quantities. It falls under "Food & Beverages" (non-Hazmat).
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

23. **MLB42735632: Fibra Branca Para Limpezas Leves NÃ£o Abrasiva Vidros Kit 10**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product consists of cleaning pads/fibers made of polyester. These are physical cleaning tools, not chemical products. They fall under "Furniture & Home Goods" or "Basic tools and hardware" (non-chemical), which are non-Hazmat indicators. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

24. **MLB47134995: Tapete Peludo Sala Quarto 2x2,50 Pelo Alto 200x2,50 Cor Cinza**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is a rug/carpet made of polypropylene. It falls under the "Furniture & Home Goods" category, which is explicitly listed as a non-Hazmat indicator. There are no attributes suggesting any hazardous characteristics.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

25. **MLB19766031: Creme De Morango Com Tequila Ballena**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an alcoholic beverage (cream liqueur) with 16% alcohol by volume. Similar to wine and lower-proof spirits, it's generally considered a consumer beverage and not classified as Hazmat for transport in consumer quantities. Its alcohol content is unlikely to result in a flash point low enough to meet the Class 3 criteria for common transport regulations.
    *   **Classification:** Non-Hazmat

26. **MLB50850725: Kit C/10 Pano De ChÃ£o + Brinde Louvre Moda Casa Limpeza Xadrez 70x45cm Cor Xadrez Branco E Azul**
    *   **Reasoning:** This product consists of cleaning cloths made of cotton. These are physical household items.

    *   **Classification:** Hazmat
    *   **Reason:** Toxic substance (pesticide/insecticide).
    *   **Confidence:** High

    *   **Reasoning:** This product is an alcoholic beverage (lemon liqueur) with 28% alcohol by volume. Liquids with an alcohol content this high are likely to have a flash point below 23Â°C, which would classify them as Class 3 Flammable Liquids according to the Hazmat definition ("Flammable liquids with an initial boiling point greater than 35Â°C and a flash point less than 23Â°C").

Batch 46:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

1.  **Analyze Product Title and Attributes:** Extract key information such as product type, materials, and specific functions (e.g., cleaner, paint, repellent, food, electronic device).
2.  **Cross-reference with Hazmat Definition:**
    *   Check for explicit mentions of hazardous characteristics (flammable, toxic, corrosive, etc.).
    *   Look for categories listed under "HAZMAT Indicators" (Chemical products, Aerosols, Batteries, etc.).
    *   Look for categories listed under "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" (Food, Electronics, Textiles, Furniture, Basic Tools).
3.  **Consult Examples:** Compare the product with the provided examples of Hazmat and non-Hazmat goods to see if similar items are listed.
4.  **Determine Classification:**
    *   If a product clearly falls under a Hazmat category or exhibits hazardous characteristics/indicators, classify as Hazmat. Provide the reason and a confidence level (high if explicit, medium/low if inferred but plausible).
    *   If a product clearly falls under a Non-Hazmat category and shows no hazardous characteristics, classify as Non-Hazmat.
    *   If uncertain but there's a plausible hazardous characteristic (e.g., a "chemical product" that *could* be flammable/toxic, but isn't explicitly stated), lean towards Hazmat with lower confidence, as per guidelines ("If not certain of the classification, output as hazmat with lower confidence.").

Batch 50:
Detailed reasoning process:

1.  **Analyze the Hazmat Definition:** The definition clearly outlines what constitutes a Hazmat, categorizing them into nine classes and providing examples. Key indicators for Hazmat include being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, allergenic, compressed gases/liquids, or hot materials. Specific examples provided are crucial, such as "Aerosol sprays and pressurized containers" and "Chemical products (acids, solvents, cleaners)." Conversely, "Food and beverages," "Complete electronic devices (phones, computers)," "Natural materials (cotton, wood, leather)," "Basic tools and hardware," "Office supplies," "Personal care items (non-aerosol)," and "Furniture and home goods" are explicitly listed as non-Hazmat.

    *   The materials (Aluminum, Carbon, Ceramic, Granite, Marble, Titanium) are common for kitchenware and are not listed as hazardous substances in the provided definition. The anti-adhesive coating on a finished product like a pan does not make it a Hazmat.

Batch 60:
**Reasoning Process:**

I will classify each product by comparing its description and attributes to the provided Hazmat definition and examples. I will pay close attention to materials, intended use, and any keywords that indicate hazardous properties (e.g., flammable, corrosive, toxic, gas, aerosol, chemical).

For each product:
1.  **Analyze `TITLE` and `ATTRIBUTES`**: Identify the core nature of the product and its components.
2.  **Cross-reference with Hazmat Definition**: Check if the product's characteristics align with any of the nine Hazmat classes or the general Hazmat indicators (chemical products, aerosol sprays, flammable/corrosive/toxic substances, etc.).
3.  **Cross-reference with Non-Hazmat Examples**: Check if the product falls clearly into any of the non-Hazmat categories (food, electronics, clothing, furniture, basic tools, non-aerosol personal care, office supplies, non-chemical automotive).
4.  **Determine Classification**: Based on the comparison, decide if it's Hazmat or Non-Hazmat.
5.  **Formulate Reason and Confidence**: If Hazmat, provide a specific reason linked to the definition and assign a confidence level (high if clear, medium/low if ambiguous but leaning Hazmat). If Non-Hazmat, no reason or confidence is required by the schema.

Batch 61:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

I have reviewed each product's title and attributes to identify any keywords or characteristics that align with the Hazmat definition's nine classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances) or the "HAZMAT Indicators".

Conversely, I looked for "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" such as food, complete electronic devices, natural materials, basic tools, office supplies, non-aerosol personal care items, furniture, and general home goods.

For all the products listed, the descriptions consistently point to common household items, furniture, plumbing fixtures, or cleaning accessories that do not inherently contain hazardous materials, are not pressurized, are not chemicals with explicitly stated hazardous properties (flammable, corrosive, toxic), nor are they items like standalone batteries or asbestos. The materials mentioned (e.g., MDP, metal, plastic, glass, cotton, ceramic) are generally non-hazardous.

The product "Antiespuma Tigre 150mm Elimina Anti-mal Cheiro De Banheiro" (MLB20578765) was initially considered for Hazmat due to being a "chemical product/cleaner". However, the definition specifies that a Hazmat "poses a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment" and lists specific hazardous characteristics. Without any explicit mention of flammability, corrosivity, toxicity, or other specific hazards for this particular cleaner, and given it's a common household item, it does not meet the criteria to be classified as Hazmat. Similar household cleaners, if not explicitly hazardous, are generally not considered Hazmat for transport in consumer quantities.

Therefore, all products are classified as Non-Hazmat.

Batch 62:
Here's the Hazmat classification for each product based on the provided definition:

**Reasoning Process:**

I will evaluate each product based on its title and attributes, comparing them against the Hazmat definition and its nine classes (Explosives, Gases, Flammable Liquids, Flammable Solids, Oxidizing Agents, Toxic/Infectious Substances, Radioactive Substances, Corrosive Substances, Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances). I will also refer to the "HAZMAT Indicators" and "NON-HAZMAT Indicators" provided.

*   **For Non-Hazmat products:** I will confirm that they fall under categories like "Furniture & Home Goods", "Basic tools and hardware", "Office supplies", "Personal care items (non-aerosol)", or "Complete electronic devices" and do not exhibit any hazardous characteristics.
*   **For Hazmat products:** I will identify the specific hazardous characteristic (e.g., flammable, corrosive, toxic, gas, etc.) and the corresponding Hazmat class if applicable, and state the confidence level.

Many household cleaners, even if not highly flammable, can be corrosive or harmful if misused or spilled, falling under Class 6 (Toxic and Infectious Substances - "Toxic substances harmful to human health") or Class 8 (Corrosive Substances). Given its classification as a "chemical product" and "cleaner", it should be treated as Hazmat.
    *   **Classification:** Hazmat.
    *   **Reason:** It is a chemical cleaner, explicitly listed as a HAZMAT indicator. Although not flammable, other potential hazards (e.g., irritant, toxic, corrosive) are not ruled out and are common for cleaning agents.
