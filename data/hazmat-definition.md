### Definition of a Hazmat (Hazardous Material)

A Hazmat (Hazardous Material) is a substance (solid, liquid, or gas) that poses a risk to health, safety, property, or the environment, even when not being transported. These materials are classified based on their hazardous characteristics, such as being radioactive, flammable, explosive, corrosive, oxidizing, asphyxiating, biohazardous, toxic, poisonous, pathogenic, or allergenic, and can also include compressed gases/liquids or hot materials.

### Examples of Hazmat and Reasons for Classification

The article categorizes dangerous goods (which include hazardous materials) into nine classes. Below are examples extracted from these classes, along with the reason for their classification:

**Class 1: Explosives**
*   **TNT, Dynamite, Nitroglycerine, ANFO:** Explosives with a mass explosion hazard.
*   **Rocket propellant, Display fireworks:** Explosives with a minor blast or projection hazard.
*   **Consumer fireworks, Ammunition:** Explosives with a major fire hazard.
*   **Blasting agents:** Insensitive substances with a mass explosion hazard.

**Class 2: Gases**
*   **Acetylene, Hydrogen, Propane:** Flammable gases, as they ignite on contact with an ignition source.
*   **Nitrogen, Neon, Carbon dioxide:** Non-flammable gases, as they are neither flammable nor poisonous, and include cryogenic gases/liquids.
*   **Fluorine, Chlorine, Hydrogen cyanide:** Poisonous gases, as they are liable to cause death or serious injury if inhaled.

**Class 3: Flammable Liquids**
*   **Diethyl ether, Carbon disulfide:** Flammable liquids with an initial boiling point of 35�C or less and any flash point.
*   **Gasoline (petrol), Acetone:** Flammable liquids with an initial boiling point greater than 35�C and a flash point less than 23�C.
*   **Kerosene, Diesel fuel:** Flammable liquids that do not meet the criteria for Packing Group I or II.

**Class 4: Flammable Solids**
*   **Nitrocellulose, Magnesium, Safety or strike-anywhere matches:** Flammable solids that are easily ignited and readily combustible.
*   **Aluminium alkyls, White phosphorus:** Spontaneously combustible solids that ignite spontaneously.
*   **Sodium, Calcium, Potassium, Calcium carbide:** Solids dangerous when wet, as they emit a flammable gas or react violently with water.

**Class 5: Oxidizing Agents and Organic Peroxides**
*   **Calcium hypochlorite, Ammonium nitrate, Hydrogen peroxide, Potassium permanganate:** Oxidizing agents (other than organic peroxides) that can cause or contribute to the combustion of other material.
*   **Benzoyl peroxides, Cumene hydroperoxide:** Organic peroxides, which are thermally unstable substances liable to undergo exothermic self-accelerating decomposition.

**Class 6: Toxic and Infectious Substances**
*   **Potassium cyanide, Mercuric chloride:** Toxic substances liable to cause death or serious injury if inhaled, swallowed, or by skin absorption.
*   **Pesticides, Methylene chloride:** Toxic substances harmful to human health.
*   **Virus cultures, Pathology specimens, Used intravenous needles:** Biohazardous substances classified as infectious materials.

**Class 7: Radioactive Substances**
*   **Uranium, Plutonium:** Radioactive substances that emit ionizing radiation.

**Class 8: Corrosive Substances**
*   **Sulfuric acid, Hydrochloric acid (Acids):** Corrosive substances that can dissolve organic tissue or severely corrode certain metals.
*   **Potassium hydroxide, Sodium hydroxide (Alkalis):** Corrosive substances that can dissolve organic tissue or severely corrode certain metals.

**Class 9: Miscellaneous Hazardous Substances and Articles**
*   **Asbestos:** Hazardous substance that does not fall into other categories.
*   **Air-bag inflators, Self inflating life rafts:** Articles that present a hazard during transport but are not covered by other classes.
*   **Dry ice:** Hazardous substance (e.g., due to asphyxiation risk from sublimation in confined spaces or extreme cold).
